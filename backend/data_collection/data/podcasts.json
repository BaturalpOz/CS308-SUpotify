        "episode_description": "Green noise is a type of sound that is similar to white noise, but with a slightly different frequency spectrum. It is often described as a gentle, flowing sound that can help you relax and unwind. Green noise blocks inconsistent bedroom sounds, such as street noise, and induces relaxation, leading to better sleep quality. Unlike white noise, green noise sounds more natural, resembling rain or waves. Green noise can be used as a background sound to better focus while reading, studying, or doing homework. It is also a great way to fight intrusive thoughts and worries while trying to meditate or fall asleep. The 8+ hours of deep green noise will continue uninterrupted (after the intro and ads) ensuring you stay asleep all night and wake up fully rested and recovered.

        "episode_description": "As we're in the period between Christmas and New Year, the gap between episodes is going to be longer than normal, and the podcast proper is going to be back on January the ninth. So nobody has to wait around for another fortnight for a new episode, I thought I'd upload some old Patreon bonus episodes to fill the gap. Every year around Christmas the bonus episodes I do tend to be on Christmas songs and so this week I'm uploading three of those. These are older episodes, so don't have the same production values as more recent episodes, and are also shorter than more recent bonuses, but I hope they're still worth listening to.    Hello, and welcome to this week's second Patreon bonus episode. I'm recording this on December the twenty-third, so whether you hear this before Christmas is largely down to how quickly we can get the main episode edited and uploaded. Hopefully, this is going up on Christmas Eve and you're all feeling appropriately festive.  Normally for the Patreon bonuses in the last week of December I choose a particularly Christmassy record from the time period we're covering in the main podcast -- usually a perennial Christmas hit like something off the Phil Spector Christmas album or the Elvis Christmas album. However, this year we're in the mid sixties, a period when none of the big hits of US or UK Christmas music were released, because it's after the peak of US Christmas music and before the peak of UK Christmas music. There were Christmas albums by people like James Brown, but they weren't major parts of the discography.  So today, we're going to have a brief run-through of the Beatles' Christmas records. These were flexi-discs -- which for those of you who are too young to remember them were records pressed on very, very, thin, cheap plastic, which used to be attached to things like kids' comics or cereal boxes as promotional gimmicks -- sent out to members of the group's fan club. In a way, these were the Beatles' very own Patreon bonuses, sent out to fans and supporters, and not essential works, but hopefully interesting and fun.  They very rarely had anything like a full song, being mostly made up of sketches and recorded messages, and other than a limited-edition vinyl reissue a few years back they've never been put on general release -- though one song from the discs, \"Christmas Time is Here Again\", *was* released as a B-side of the CD single of \"Free as A Bird\" in 1995:  [Excerpt: The Beatles, \"Christmas Time is Here Again\"]  Other than that, the Christmas records remain one of those parts of the Beatles catalogue which have never seen a proper widespread release. The first record was made on October the 17th 1963, at the same recording session as \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\", at the instigation of Tony Barrow, the group's publicist, who also came up with a script for the group to depart from:  [Excerpt, the Beatles' first Christmas record]  Barrow apparently edited the recording himself, using scissors and tape, and much of that was just taking out the swearing.  Incidentally, I've seen some American sources talking about the word \"Crimble\" being a word that the Beatles made up themselves, but it's actually a fairly standard bit of Scouse slang. The second Christmas record was recorded at the end of the sessions for Beatles For Sale and was much the same kind of thing, though this time they incorporated sound effects:  [Excerpt: The Beatles' Second Christmas Record]  That was never sent to American fans. Instead, they got a cardboard copy of an edited version of the first record (it's possible to make records out of cardboard, but they can only be played a handful of times). They wouldn't get another Christmas record until 1968, though British fans kept receiving them.  The third record sees the group parodying other people's hits, including a brief rendition of \"It's the Same Old Song\" interrupted by George Harrison saying they can't sing it because of copyright, and an attempt to sing Barry McGuire's \"Eve of Destruction\" and \"Auld Lang Syne\" at the same time:  [Excerpt: The Beatles' Third Christmas Record]  The fourth record, from 1966, was recorded during the early sessions for \"Strawberry Fields Forever\", and titled \"Pantomime: Everywhere It's Christmas\". For those outside the UK and its sphere of cultural influence, pantomime is a British Xmas stage tradition which is very hard to explain if you've not experienced it, involving performances that are ostensibly of fairy stories like Cinderella or Snow White, but also usually involving drag performances -- the male lead is usually played by a young woman, while there's usually an old woman character played by a man in drag -- with audience participation, songs, and old jokes of the \"I do declare, the Prince's balls get bigger every year!\" type.  As the title suggests, then, the 1966 Christmas record is an attempt at an actual narrative of sorts, though a surreal, incoherent one. It comes across very much like the Goon show -- though like one of the later episodes where Milligan has lost all sense of narrative coherence:  [Excerpt: The Beatles, \"Pantomime: Everywhere It's Christmas\"]  it's probably the best of the group's Christmas efforts, and certainly the most fully realised to this point. The 1967 Christmas record, \"Christmas Time is Here Again\", is even more ambitious. It's another narrative, which sees the group playing a fictitious group called the Ravellers, auditioning for the BBC:  [Excerpt: The Beatles, \"Christmas Time is Here Again\"]  It also features parodies of broadcasting formats, which I've seen a few people suggest were inspired by the Bonzo Dog Band's then-recent Craig Torso Show radio performances, but which seem to me more indicative just of a general shared sense of humour:  [Excerpt: The Beatles, \"Christmas Time is Here Again\"]  But that record has become most famous for having one of the closest things on any of these records to a full song, the title track \"Christmas Time is Here Again\":  [Excerpt: The Beatles, \"Christmas Time is Here Again\"]  As well as later being issued as the B-side of a CD single, that was also remade by Ringo as a solo record:  [Excerpt: Ringo Starr, \"Christmas Time is Here Again\"]  Although my favourite use of the song is actually as an interpolation, with slightly altered lyrics, in \"Xmas Again\" by Stew of the Negro Problem, one of my favourite current songwriters:  [Excerpt: Stew, \"Xmas Again\"]  \"Christmas Time is Here Again\" would be the last Christmas record the group would make together. For their final two Christmas releases, they recorded their parts separately and got their friend, the DJ Kenny Everett, who was known at this point for his tricks with tape editing, and who shared their sense of humour (he later went on to become a successful TV comedian) to collage them together into something listenable. The highlight of the 1968 record comes from George's contribution. George, a lover of the ukulele, got Tiny Tim to record his version of \"Nowhere Man\" for the record:  [Excerpt: Tiny Tim, \"Nowhere Man\"]  And for the seventh and final Christmas single, recorded after the group had split up but before the split was announced, Everett once again cobbled it together from separate recordings, this time a chat between John and Yoko, Ringo improvising a song and plugging his new film, and Paul singing an original Christmas song:  [Excerpt: Paul McCartney, \"Merry, Merry, Year\"]  George's contribution was a single sentence.  In 1970, the fan club members got one final record -- an actual vinyl album, compiling all the previous Christmas records in one place. All the Beatles would in future record solo Christmas singles, some of which became perennial classics, but there would never be another Beatles Christmas record  [Excerpt, the end of the third Beatles Christmas record]"

Transcript  It's the middle of December, as you have probably noticed, and that means it's a time when the airwaves in both the UK and the US are dominated by Christmas music. The music that's most prominent in the UK will have to wait until we get to the seventies for a discussion, but this week and next week in these bonus episodes I'll be looking at a few American Christmas classics:  [Excerpt: Gene Autry, \"Here Comes Santa Claus\"]  If I'd been doing these Patreon bonus episodes from the beginning of the podcast, rather than waiting for the first six months or so to do them on a regular basis, I'd have covered Gene Autry in one by about the fourth episode. He's someone whose name you'll have heard a lot in the podcast -- he was an influence on all sorts of musicians we've looked at, in all areas of music. Jerry Lee Lewis, Sam Cooke, Hank Ballard, Bo Diddley, Bill Haley, Fats Domino, and Les Paul all acknowledged him as someone they were trying to imitate in one way or another, and that's just the ones where I've been able to find clear confirmation.  Autry was not, in any direct sense, a precursor to rock and roll. He didn't make records that included any of the elements that later became prominent in the new music, and he didn't have a rebellious image at all. But from the early 1930s to the early 1950s, he was the single biggest star in country music. He starred in many films, had his own radio show, had a line of comics about him, and he was so popular that even his *horse* had his own radio and TV show. British people from my generation may well remember Champion, The Wonder Horse still being repeated as kids' TV in the eighties.  THAT's how big Gene Autry was, and so it's unsurprising that he influenced pretty much every singer of note in the rock and roll field.  But he was also, along with Bing Crosby, one of the people who pioneered American secular Christmas music:  [Excerpt: Gene Autry, \"Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer\"]  I specify \"American\" secular Christmas music here, because one thing that differs between the US and the UK when it comes to Christmas is the music that's ubiquitous. In the UK, Christmas music mostly means glam rock -- you hear Slade and Wizzard incessantly, and other 70s artists like Mud. In the US, though, it means primarily the music of the forties and fifties -- the music of people like Gene Autry.  Autry started his career as just another country singer, who performed as \"Oklahoma's Yodelling Cowboy\". His early recordings were very much in the style of Jimmie Rodgers, and were very different from his later clean-cut image:  [Excerpt: Gene Autry, \"Black Bottom Blues\"]  But in 1932 he had a hit with a song he wrote, which would soon become a standard of country music, a rather maudlin ballad called \"That Silver-Haired Daddy of Mine\":  [Excerpt: Gene Autry, \"That Silver-Haired Daddy of Mine\"]  As a result of that hit, Autry started appearing in films. The first film he appeared in was a serial -- The Phantom Empire -- in which he starred as a singing cowboy who is kidnapped by people from the underground super-science kingdom Murania, descendants of the lost tribe of Mu, and has to help them defend themselves from an evil scientist who wants to steal their radium. It may not surprise you that the writer of the film came up with the plot for it while on nitrous oxide, having a tooth extracted.  Autry made another forty-four films in the next five years, and every year from 1937 through 1942 he was the top star of Western films in the US, as well as having a whole series of hits with songs like \"Blueberry Hill\":  [Excerpt: Gene Autry, \"Blueberry Hill\"]  However, in 1942 he enlisted in the army, against the wishes of Republic, the film studio for whom he worked. They told him that if he was just going to go off and fight Nazis instead of making singing cowboy films, they were going to promote Roy Rogers instead. So from 1942 through 1945, Autry was off fighting in the Second World War. After he got back, he was the *second* most successful singing cowboy film star, after Rogers.  It was in 1947 that Autry got the inspiration for the song that would define his career. He was riding his horse in a Christmas parade, known as the Santa Claus Lane parade, and he heard spectators saying \"here comes Santa Claus\":  [Excerpt: Gene Autry, \"Here Comes Santa Claus\"]  \"Here Comes Santa Claus\" not only charted that Xmas, it charted the Xmas after as well. Given that Autry's recording career was slowly fading, it seemed to make sense for him to record another Christmas song about Santa and see if he could repeat his success:  [Excerpt: Gene Autry, \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\"]  Not only did that go to number one -- and become the first number one of the fifties -- but \"Here Comes Santa Claus\" charted for the third year in a row. So of course, the next year (after an Easter single, \"Peter Cottontail\", which also charted, but didn't have the same repeat success as the Christmas songs), he recorded yet another Christmas single, \"Frosty the Snowman\":  [Excerpt: Gene Autry, \"Frosty the Snowman\"]  The next year, he didn't release a Christmas single at all, and he seemed to lose momentum. In 1952 he released one final Christmas record, \"Up on the Housetop\":  [Excerpt: Gene Autry, \"Up on the Housetop\"]  But that had nothing like the success his earlier Christmas records had. He carried on making films and TV shows until the mid-fifties, and he finally retired in 1964. He died in 1998. His Christmas records still occasionally hit the charts in December, and regularly feature in the special Holiday charts Billboard publish every year."

        "episode_description": "As we're in the period between Christmas and New Year, the gap between episodes is going to be longer than normal, and the podcast proper is going to be back on January the ninth. So nobody has to wait around for another fortnight for a new episode, I thought I'd upload some old Patreon bonus episodes to fill the gap. Every year around Christmas the bonus episodes I do tend to be on Christmas songs and so this week I'm uploading three of those. These are older episodes, so don't have the same production values as more recent episodes, and are also shorter than more recent bonuses, but I hope they're still worth listening to.    Transcript  We talked in the last bonus episode about how the American Christmas music canon more or less ends in 1963. One record that just got in under that wire was \"Little Saint Nick\", recorded by the Beach Boys in October 1963 and released in December:  [Excerpt: The Beach Boys, \"Little Saint Nick\"]  Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys' leader, was apparently inspired to write a Christmas song by Phil Spector -- Wilson turned up to at least one of the sessions for the Spector Christmas album, and had briefly played piano during a couple of takes of \"Santa Claus is Coming to Town\", although he wasn't actually on the record itself, as Spector decided he wasn't a good enough player.  The date the Beach Boys recorded their Christmas song, October the twentieth 1963, was actually a historic date for the group. We'll talk about this more in a few weeks' time when we next look at the Beach Boys in the main podcast, but they had gone through a bit of a lineup shuffle, and David Marks had played his last gig with the group the night before, while Al Jardine had rejoined the band shortly before that. That meant that this was the first session since their first single at which the Beach Boys were the classic five-person lineup of Brian, Carl, and Dennis Wilson, Mike Love, and Al Jardine.  There seems to be some confusion about what happened at that session, as they recorded two backing tracks. One of them became the \"Little Saint Nick\" that was a hit, but they also recorded a track that later became an album track called \"Drive In\":  [Excerpt: The Beach Boys, \"Drive In\"]  But there also exists a recording of that backing track, but with the lyrics to \"Little Saint Nick\":  [Excerpt: The Beach Boys, \"Drive In (Little Saint Nick version)\"]  I've seen conflicting accounts of how that track came to exist. Some say that they tried both backing tracks with the same lyrics at the original session, and that they then wrote the \"Drive In\" lyrics for the track that didn't make the cut as \"Little Saint Nick\", while others say that they actually sung the \"Little Saint Nick\" lyrics to the \"Drive In\" track as a joke a few months later, long after the original \"Little Saint Nick\" had already come out.  Whichever is the truth, the version of \"Little Saint Nick\" that eventually came out as a single was this one, which became one of the last holiday classics in the US Christmas canon:  [Excerpt: The Beach Boys, \"Little Saint Nick\"]  \"Little Saint Nick\" is very clearly modelled on an earlier hit by the group, \"Little Deuce Coupe\", and so it makes sense to me that the track that was chosen was the originally intended one, as musically that's quite close to the earlier song.  \"Little Saint Nick\" was only a moderate success on the main chart, but it made number three on Billboard's Christmas Singles chart, which was enough of a success that the group decided the next year to record a full Christmas album. That album included a remixed version of \"Little Saint Nick\", with the backing track stripped down to sound more like the rest of the album's first side, which was rush-recorded with few overdubs.  That album was recorded in a style that the Beach Boys did quite a bit at that time, with a side for \"the kids\" -- uptempo original songs -- and a side for \"the adults\", with orchestral versions of more traditional Christmas songs, arranged by the Four Freshmen's arranger Dick Reynolds, including a gorgeous version of \"We Three Kings\":  [Excerpt: The Beach Boys, \"We Three Kings\"]  The Beach Boys would have another attempt at making a Christmas album, in 1977, which went unreleased at the time -- mostly because much of it is truly terrible. However, there were a couple of worthwhile tracks on the album -- Brian Wilson's \"Winter Symphony\":  [Excerpt: The Beach Boys, \"Winter Symphony\"]  And his brother Dennis' \"Morning Christmas\":  [Excerpt: Dennis Wilson, \"Morning Christmas\"]  Much of that album has since been released, with their 1964 Christmas album, on the compilation \"Ultimate Christmas\". Both Brian Wilson and Mike Love have since released solo Christmas albums. Both are patchy affairs, but Wilson's has a lovely version of \"Joy to the World\" as a bonus track:  [Excerpt: Brian Wilson, \"Joy to the World\"]  And it has a few other genuinely nice tracks, while the highlight of Love's is rather less impressive -- a reworking of \"Shortenin' Bread\" titled \"Reason For the Season\":  [Excerpt: Mike Love, \"Reason for the Season\"]  Both albums also include remakes of \"Little Saint Nick\", the one Beach Boys Christmas song that has really entered the consciousness of the general public. And while this podcast episode might have ended up being too late for you to still be hearing that one on the radio, I'm sure you'll start hearing it again, for the fifty-eighth straight year, come the last week of November 2021. Because some things, at least, stay the same no matter what's happening in the rest of the world."

The podcast has been keeping to a fortnightly schedule for the last few months, but at this time of year I have commitments to visit family and friends for Christmas and New Year, and I've learned that when I'm away from home I can't record and shouldn't even make the attempt. Also, a lot of people don't have time to listen to new podcasts over the Christmas period. So here's what's going to happen with the podcast between now and the beginning of the year. I'm recording a full podcast episode today, and that will be going up either Tuesday night or Wednesday morning, depending how long it takes to edit, so two weeks after the last episode, and then there will be a gap for Christmas and New Year. I will be doing Patreon bonuses during that time on a weekly basis as normal -- they take much less recording time than the main episodes, and I can prerecord them in advance -- but the next main episode of the podcast after this week's will go up on Monday the ninth of January, a little less than three weeks after the last one, rather than the normal two.\u00a0 However, to fill in the gap I'm going to put up a few old Patreon bonus episodes over Christmas week. Every year around this time my Patreon bonus episodes tend to be about something seasonal, and so I'll put up a few of the old ones on the main feed for those of you who haven't heard them. These are older bonus episodes, some from four years ago, and so not in the same style as my more recent work, and mostly around ten minutes or so in length, but they'll hopefully be of interest to anyone who is looking for something seasonal to listen to. Happy holidays to those who celebrate a winter holiday at this time of year, and my sympathies to those who don't or for whom it's a difficult time for whatever reason. I'll see you in a couple of days for the next proper episode."

I referred to two biographies of Barrett in this episode --\u00a0A Very Irregular Head by Rob Chapman is the one I would recommend, and the one whose narrative I have largely followed. Some of the information has been superseded by newer discoveries, but Chapman is almost unique in people writing about Barrett in that he actually seems to care about the facts and try to get things right rather than make up something more interesting.\u00a0Crazy Diamond by Mike Watkinson and Pete Anderson is much less reliable, but does have quite a few interview quotes that aren't duplicated by Chapman.  Information about Joe Boyd comes from Boyd's book\u00a0White Bicycles.  In this and future episodes on Pink Floyd I'm also relying on Nick Mason's\u00a0Inside Out: A Personal History of Pink Floyd and\u00a0Pink Floyd: All the Songs\u00a0by Jean-Michel Guesdon and Philippe Margotin.  The compilation\u00a0Relics contains many of the most important tracks from Barrett's time with Pink Floyd, while\u00a0Piper at the Gates of Dawn is his one full album with them. Those who want a fuller history of his time with the group will want to get\u00a0Piper and also the box set Cambridge St/ation 1965-1967.  Barrett only released two solo albums during his career. They're available as a bundle here. Completists will also want the rarities and outtakes collection\u00a0Opel.\u00a0  ERRATA:  I talk about \u201cInterstellar Overdrive\u201d as if Barrett wrote it solo. The song is credited to all four members, but it was Barrett who came up with the riff I talk about.  And annoyingly, given the lengths I went to to deal correctly with Barrett's name, I repeatedly refer to \"Dave\" Gilmour, when Gilmour prefers David.  Patreon  This podcast is brought to you by the generosity of my backers on Patreon.\u00a0Why not join them?  Transcript  A note before I begin -- this episode deals with drug use and mental illness, so anyone who might be upset by those subjects might want to skip this one.  But also, there's a rather unique problem in how I deal with the name of the main artist in the story today. The man everyone knows as Syd Barrett was born Roger Barrett, used that name with his family for his whole life, and in later years very strongly disliked being called \"Syd\", yet everyone other than his family called him that at all times until he left the music industry, and that's the name that appears on record labels, including his solo albums.  I don't believe it's right to refer to people by names they choose not to go by themselves, but the name Barrett went by throughout his brief period in the public eye was different from the one he went by later, and by all accounts he was actually distressed by its use in later years. So what I'm going to do in this episode is refer to him as \"Roger Barrett\" when a full name is necessary for disambiguation or just \"Barrett\" otherwise, but I'll leave any quotes from other people referring to \"Syd\" as they were originally phrased.  In future episodes on Pink Floyd, I'll refer to him just as Barrett, but in episodes where I discuss his influence on other artists, I will probably have to use \"Syd Barrett\" because otherwise people who haven't listened to this episode won't know what on Earth I'm talking about.  Anyway, on with the show.  \u201cIt\u2019s gone!\u201d sighed the Rat, sinking back in his seat again. \u201cSo beautiful and strange and new. Since it was to end so soon, I almost wish I had never heard it. For it has roused a longing in me that is pain, and nothing seems worth while but just to hear that sound once more and go on listening to it for ever. No! There it is again!\u201d he cried, alert once more. Entranced, he was silent for a long space, spellbound. \u201cNow it passes on and I begin to lose it,\u201d he said presently. \u201cO Mole! the beauty of it! The merry bubble and joy, the thin, clear, happy call of the distant piping! Such music I never dreamed of, and the call in it is stronger even than the music is sweet! Row on, Mole, row! For the music and the call must be for us.\u201d  That's a quote from a chapter titled \"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\" from the classic children's book The Wind in the Willows -- a book which for most of its length is a fairly straightforward story about anthropomorphic animals having jovial adventures, but which in that one chapter has Rat and Mole suddenly encounter the Great God Pan and have a hallucinatory, transcendental experience caused by his music, one so extreme it's wiped from their minds, as they simply cannot process it.  The book, and the chapter, was a favourite of Roger Barrett, a young child born in Cambridge in 1946. Barrett came from an intellectual but not especially bookish family. His father, Dr. Arthur Barrett, was a pathologist -- there's a room in Addenbrooke's Hospital named after him -- but he was also an avid watercolour painter, a world-leading authority on fungi, and a member of the Cambridge Philharmonic Society who was apparently an extraordinarily good singer; while his mother Winifred was a stay-at-home mother who was nonetheless very active in the community, organising a local Girl Guide troupe.  They never particularly encouraged their family to read, but young Roger did particularly enjoy the more pastoral end of the children's literature of the time. As well as the Wind in the Willows he also loved Alice in Wonderland, and the Little Grey Men books -- a series of stories about tiny gnomes and their adventures in the countryside.  But his two big passions were music and painting. He got his first ukulele at age eleven, and by the time his father died, just before Roger's sixteenth birthday, he had graduated to playing a full-sized guitar. At the time his musical tastes were largely the same as those of any other British teenager -- he liked Chubby Checker, for example -- though he did have a tendency to prefer the quirkier end of things, and some of the first songs he tried to play on the guitar were those of Joe Brown:  [Excerpt: Joe Brown, \"I'm Henry VIII I Am\"]  Barrett grew up in Cambridge, and for those who don't know it, Cambridge is an incubator of a very particular kind of eccentricity. The university tends to attract rather unworldly intellectual overachievers to the city -- people who might not be able to survive in many other situations but who can thrive in that one -- and every description of Barrett's father suggests he was such a person -- Barrett's sister Rosemary has said that she believes that most of the family were autistic, though whether this is a belief based on popular media portrayals or a deeper understanding I don't know.  But certainly Cambridge is full of eccentric people with remarkable achievements, and such people tend to have children with a certain type of personality, who try simultaneously to live up to and rebel against expectations of greatness that come from having parents who are regarded as great, and to do so with rather less awareness of social norms than the typical rebel has. In the case of Roger Barrett, he, like so many others of his generation, was encouraged to go into the sciences -- as indeed his father had, both in his career as a pathologist and in his avocation as a mycologist. The fifties and sixties were a time, much like today, when what we now refer to as the STEM subjects were regarded as new and exciting and modern.  But rather than following in his father's professional footsteps, Roger Barrett instead followed his hobbies. Dr. Barrett was a painter and musician in his spare time, and Roger was to turn to those things to earn his living.  For much of his teens, it seemed that art would be the direction he would go in. He was, everyone agrees, a hugely talented painter, and he was particularly noted for his mastery of colours.  But he was also becoming more and more interested in R&B music, especially the music of Bo Diddley, who became his new biggest influence:  [Excerpt: Bo Diddley, \"Who Do You Love?\"]  He would often spend hours with his friend Dave Gilmour, a much more advanced guitarist, trying to learn blues riffs.  By this point Barrett had already received the nickname \"Syd\". Depending on which story you believe, he either got it when he started attending a jazz club where an elderly jazzer named Sid Barrett played, and the people were amused that their youngest attendee, like one of the oldest, was called Barrett; or, more plausibly, he turned up to a Scout meeting once wearing a flat cap rather than the normal scout beret, and he got nicknamed \"Sid\" because it made him look working-class and \"Sid\" was a working-class sort of name.  In 1962, by the time he was sixteen, Barrett joined a short-lived group called Geoff Mott and the Mottoes, on rhythm guitar. The group's lead singer, Geoff Mottlow, would go on to join a band called the Boston Crabs who would have a minor hit in 1965 with a version of the Coasters song \"Down in Mexico\":  [Excerpt: The Boston Crabs, \"Down in Mexico\"]  The bass player from the Mottoes, Tony Sainty, and the drummer Clive Welham, would go on to form another band, The Jokers Wild, with Barrett's friend Dave Gilmour. Barrett also briefly joined another band, Those Without, but his time with them was similarly brief.  Some sources -- though ones I consider generally less reliable -- say that the Mottoes' bass player wasn't Tony Sainty, but was Roger Waters, the son of one of Barrett's teachers, and that one of the reasons the band split up was that Waters had moved down to London to study architecture. I don't think that's the case, but it's definitely true that Barrett knew Waters, and when he moved to London himself the next year to go to Camberwell Art College, he moved into a house where Waters was already living. Two previous tenants at the same house, Nick Mason and Richard Wright, had formed a loose band with Waters and various other amateur musicians like Keith Noble, Shelagh Noble, and Clive Metcalfe. That band was sometimes known as the Screaming Abdabs, The Megadeaths, or The Tea Set -- the latter as a sly reference to slang terms for cannabis -- but was mostly known at first as Sigma 6, named after a manifesto by the novelist Alexander Trocchi for a kind of spontaneous university. They were also sometimes known as Leonard's Lodgers, after the landlord of the home that Barrett was moving into, Mike Leonard, who would occasionally sit in on organ and would later, as the band became more of a coherent unit, act as a roadie and put on light shows behind them -- Leonard was himself very interested in avant-garde and experimental art, and it was his idea to play around with the group's lighting.  By the time Barrett moved in with Waters in 1964, the group had settled on the Tea Set name, and consisted of Waters on bass, Mason on drums, Wright on keyboards, singer Chris Dennis, and guitarist Rado Klose. Of the group, Klose was the only one who was a skilled musician -- he was a very good jazz guitarist, while the other members were barely adequate.  By this time Barrett's musical interests were expanding to include folk music -- his girlfriend at the time talked later about him taking her to see Bob Dylan on his first UK tour and thinking\u00a0\"My first reaction was seeing all these\u00a0people like Syd. It was almost as if every town had sent one Syd\u00a0Barrett there. It was my first time seeing people like him.\"  But the music he was most into was the blues. And as the Tea Set were turning into a blues band, he joined them. He even had a name for the new band that would make them more bluesy. He'd read the back of a record cover which had named two extremely obscure blues musicians -- musicians he may never even have heard. Pink Anderson:  [Excerpt: Pink Anderson, \"Boll Weevil\"]  And Floyd Council:  [Excerpt: Floyd Council, \"Runaway Man Blues\"]  Barrett suggested that they put together the names of the two bluesmen, and presumably because \"Anderson Council\" didn't have quite the right ring, they went for The Pink Floyd -- though for a while yet they would sometimes still perform as The Tea Set, and they were sometimes also called The Pink Floyd Sound.  Dennis left soon after Barrett joined, and the new five-piece Pink Floyd Sound started trying to get more gigs. They auditioned for Ready Steady Go! and were turned down, but did get some decent support slots, including for a band called the Tridents:  [Excerpt: The Tridents, \"Tiger in Your Tank\"]  The members of the group were particularly impressed by the Tridents' guitarist and the way he altered his sound using feedback -- Barrett even sent a letter to his girlfriend with a drawing of the guitarist, one Jeff Beck, raving about how good he was.  At this point, the group were mostly performing cover versions, but they did have a handful of originals, and it was these they recorded in their first demo sessions in late 1964 and early 1965. They included \"Walk With Me Sydney\", a song written by Roger Waters as a parody of \"Work With Me Annie\" and \"Dance With Me Henry\" -- and, given the lyrics, possibly also Hank Ballard's follow-up \"Henry's Got Flat Feet (Can't Dance No More) and featuring Rick Wright's then-wife Juliette Gale as Etta James to Barrett's Richard Berry:  [Excerpt: The Tea Set, \"Walk With Me Sydney\"]  And four songs by Barrett, including one called \"Double-O Bo\" which was a Bo Diddley rip-off, and \"Butterfly\", the most interesting of these early recordings:  [Excerpt: The Tea Set, \"Butterfly\"]  At this point, Barrett was very unsure of his own vocal abilities, and wrote a letter to his girlfriend saying \"Emo says why don't I give up 'cos it sounds horrible, and I would but I can't get Fred to join because he's got a group (p'raps you knew!) so I still have to sing.\"  \"Fred\" was a nickname for his old friend Dave Gilmour, who was playing in his own band, Joker's Wild, at this point. Summer 1965 saw two important events in the life of the group. The first was that Barrett took LSD for the first time. The rest of the group weren't interested in trying it, and would indeed generally be one of the more sober bands in the rock business, despite the reputation their music got. The other members would for the most part try acid once or twice, around late 1966, but generally steer clear of it. Barrett, by contrast, took it on a very regular basis, and it would influence all the work he did from that point on.  The other event was that Rado Klose left the group. Klose was the only really proficient musician in the group, but he had very different tastes to the other members, preferring to play jazz to R&B and pop, and he was also falling behind in his university studies, and decided to put that ahead of remaining in the band.  This meant that the group members had to radically rethink the way they were making music. They couldn't rely on instrumental proficiency, so they had to rely on ideas.  One of the things they started to do was use echo. They got primitive echo devices and put both Barrett's guitar and Wright's keyboard through them, allowing them to create new sounds that hadn't been heard on stage before. But they were still mostly doing the same Slim Harpo and Bo Diddley numbers everyone else was doing, and weren't able to be particularly interesting while playing them.  But for a while they carried on doing the normal gigs, like a birthday party they played in late 1965, where on the same bill was a young American folk singer named Paul Simon, and Joker's Wild, the band Dave Gilmour was in, who backed Simon on a version of \"Johnny B. Goode\".  A couple of weeks after that party, Joker's Wild went into the studio to record their only privately-pressed five-song record, of them performing recent hits:  [Excerpt: Joker's Wild, \"Walk Like a Man\"]  But The Pink Floyd Sound weren't as musically tight as Joker's Wild, and they couldn't make a living as a cover band even if they wanted to. They had to do something different.  Inspiration then came from a very unexpected source. I mentioned earlier that one of the names the group had been performing under had been inspired by a manifesto for a spontaneous university by the writer Alexander Trocchi. Trocchi's ideas had actually been put into practice by an organisation calling itself the London Free School, based in Notting Hill.  The London Free School was an interesting mixture of people from what was then known as the New Left, but who were already rapidly aging, the people who had been the cornerstone of radical campaigning in the late fifties and early sixties, who had run the Aldermaston marches against nuclear weapons and so on, and a new breed of countercultural people who in a year or two would be defined as hippies but at the time were not so easy to pigeonhole.  These people were mostly politically radical but very privileged people -- one of the founder members of the London Free School was Peter Jenner, who was the son of a vicar and the grandson of a Labour MP -- and they were trying to put their radical ideas into practice. The London Free School was meant to be a collective of people who would help each other and themselves, and who would educate each other. You'd go to the collective wanting to learn how to do something, whether that's how to improve the housing in your area or navigate some particularly difficult piece of bureaucracy, or how to play a musical instrument, and someone who had that skill would teach you how to do it, while you hopefully taught them something else of value.  The London Free School, like all such utopian schemes, ended up falling apart, but it had a wider cultural impact than most such schemes. Britain's first underground newspaper, the International Times, was put together by people involved in the Free School, and the annual Notting Hill Carnival, which is now one of the biggest outdoor events in Britain every year with a million attendees, came from the merger of outdoor events organised by the Free School with older community events.  A group of musicians called AMM was associated with many of the people involved in the Free School. AMM performed totally improvised music, with no structure and no normal sense of melody and harmony:  [Excerpt: AMM, \"What Is There In Uselesness To Cause You Distress?\"]  Keith Rowe, the guitarist in AMM, wanted to find his own technique uninfluenced by American jazz guitarists, and thought of that in terms that appealed very strongly to the painterly Barrett, saying \"For the Americans to develop an American school of painting, they somehow had to ditch or lose European easel painting techniques. They had to make a break with the past. What did that possibly mean if you were a jazz guitar player? For me, symbolically, it was Pollock laying the canvas on the floor, which immediately abandons European easel technique. I could see that by laying the canvas down, it became inappropriate to apply easel techniques. I thought if I did that with a guitar, I would just lose all those techniques, because they would be physically impossible to do.\"  Rowe's technique-free technique inspired Barrett to make similar noises with his guitar, and to think less in terms of melody and harmony than pure sound.  AMM's first record came out in 1966. Four of the Free School people decided to put together their own record label, DNA, and they got an agreement with Elektra Records to distribute its first release -- Joe Boyd, the head of Elektra in the UK, was another London Free School member, and someone who had plenty of experience with disruptive art already, having been on the sound engineering team at the Newport Folk Festival when Dylan went electric. AMM went into the studio and recorded AMMMusic:  [Excerpt: AMM, \"What Is There In Uselesness To Cause You Distress?\"]  After that came out, though, Peter Jenner, one of the people who'd started the label, came to a realisation. He said later \"We'd made this one record with AMM. Great record, very seminal, seriously avant-garde, but I'd started adding up and I'd worked out that the deal we had, we got two percent of retail, out of which we, the label, had to pay for recording costs and pay ourselves. I came to the conclusion that we were going to have to sell a hell of a lot of records just to pay the recording costs, let alone pay ourselves any money and build a label, so I realised we had to have a pop band because pop bands sold a lot of records. It was as simple as that and I was as naive as that.\"  Jenner abandoned DNA records for the moment, and he and his friend Andrew King decided they were going to become pop managers. and they found The Pink Floyd Sound playing at an event at the Marquee, one of a series of events that were variously known as Spontaneous Underground and The Trip. Other participants in those events included\u00a0Soft Machine; Mose Allison; Donovan, performing improvised songs backed by sitar players; Graham Bond; a performer who played Bach pieces while backed by African drummers; and\u00a0The Poison Bellows, a poetry duo consisting of Spike Hawkins and Johnny Byrne, who may of all of these performers be the one who other than Pink Floyd themselves has had the most cultural impact in the UK -- after writing the exploitation novel Groupie and co-writing a film adaptation of Spike Milligan's war memoirs, Byrne became a TV screenwriter, writing many episodes of Space: 1999 and Doctor Who before creating the long-running TV series Heartbeat.  Jenner and King decided they wanted to sign The Pink Floyd Sound and make records with them, and the group agreed -- but only after their summer holidays. They were all still students, and so they dispersed during the summer. Waters and Wright went on holiday to Greece, where they tried acid for the first of only a small number of occasions and were unimpressed, while Mason went on a trip round America by Greyhound bus. Barrett, meanwhile, stayed behind, and started writing more songs, encouraged by Jenner, who insisted that the band needed to stop relying on blues covers and come up with their own material, and who saw Barrett as the focus of the group.  Jenner later described them as\u00a0\"Four not terribly competent musicians who managed between\u00a0them to create something that was extraordinary. Syd was the main\u00a0creative drive behind the band - he was the singer and lead guitarist.\u00a0Roger couldn't tune his bass because he was tone deaf, it had to be\u00a0tuned by Rick. Rick could write a bit of a tune and Roger could knock\u00a0out a couple of words if necessary. 'Set the Controls for the Heart of\u00a0the Sun' was the first song Roger ever wrote, and he only did it\u00a0because Syd encouraged everyone to write. Syd was very hesitant about\u00a0his writing, but when he produced these great songs everyone else\u00a0thought 'Well, it must be easy'\"  Of course, we know this isn't quite true -- Waters had written \"Walk with me Sydney\" -- but it is definitely the case that everyone involved thought of Barrett as the main creative force in the group, and that he was the one that Jenner was encouraging to write new material.  After the summer holidays, the group reconvened, and one of their first actions was to play a benefit for the London Free School. Jenner said later\u00a0\"Andrew King and myself were both vicars' sons,\u00a0and we knew that when you want to raise money for the parish you have\u00a0to have a social. So in a very old-fashioned way we said 'let's put on\u00a0a social'. Like in the Just William books, like a whist drive. We\u00a0thought 'You can't have a whist drive. That's not cool. Let's have a\u00a0band. That would be cool.' And the only band we knew was the band I\u00a0was starting to get involved with.\"  After a couple of these events went well, Joe Boyd suggested that they make those events a regular club night, and the UFO Club was born. Jenner and King started working on the light shows for the group, and then bringing in other people, and the light show became an integral part of the group's mystique -- rather than standing in a spotlight as other groups would, they worked in shadows, with distorted kaleidoscopic lights playing on them, distancing themselves from the audience.  The highlight of their sets was a long piece called \"Interstellar Overdrive\", and this became one of the group's first professional recordings, when they went into the studio with Joe Boyd to record it for the soundtrack of a film titled Tonite Let's All Make Love in London.  There are conflicting stories about the inspiration for the main riff for \"Interstellar Overdrive\". One apparent source is the riff from Love's version of the Bacharach and David song \"My Little Red Book\". Depending on who you ask, either Barrett was obsessed with Love's first album and copied the riff, or Peter Jenner tried to hum him the riff and Barrett copied what Jenner was humming:  [Excerpt: Love, \"My Little Red Book\"]  More prosaically, Roger Waters has always claimed that the main inspiration was from \"Old Ned\", Ron Grainer's theme tune for the sitcom Steptoe and Son (which for American listeners was remade over there as Sanford and Son):  [Excerpt: Ron Grainer, \"Old Ned\"]  Of course it's entirely possible, and even likely, that Barrett was inspired by both, and if so that would neatly sum up the whole range of Pink Floyd's influences at this point. \"My Little Red Book\" was a cover by an American garage-psych/folk-rock band of a hit by Manfred Mann, a group who were best known for pop singles but were also serious blues and jazz musicians, while Steptoe and Son was a whimsical but dark and very English sitcom about a way of life that was slowly disappearing. And you can definitely hear both influences in the main riff of the track they recorded with Boyd:  [Excerpt: The Pink Floyd, \"Interstellar Overdrive\"]  \"Interstellar Overdrive\" was one of two types of song that The Pink Floyd were performing at this time -- a long, extended, instrumental psychedelic excuse for freaky sounds, inspired by things like the second disc of Freak Out! by the Mothers of Invention. When they went into the studio again with Boyd later in January 1967, to record what they hoped would be their first single, they recorded two of the other kind of songs -- whimsical story songs inspired equally by the incidents of everyday life and by children's literature.  What became the B-side, \"Candy and a Currant Bun\", was based around the riff from \"Smokestack Lightnin'\" by Howlin' Wolf:  [Excerpt: Howlin' Wolf, \"Smokestack Lightnin'\"]  That song had become a favourite on the British blues scene, and was thus the inspiration for many songs of the type that get called \"quintessentially English\". Ray Davies, who was in many ways the major songwriter at this time who was closest to Barrett stylistically, would a year later use the riff for the Kinks song \"Last of the Steam-Powered Trains\", but in this case Barrett had originally written a song titled \"Let's Roll Another One\", about sexual longing and cannabis. The lyrics were hastily rewritten in the studio to remove the controversial drug references-- and supposedly this caused some conflict between Barrett and Waters, with Waters pushing for the change, while Barrett argued against it, though like many of the stories from this period this sounds like the kind of thing that gets said by people wanting to push particular images of both men.  Either way, the lyric was changed to be about sweet treats rather than drugs, though the lascivious elements remained in. And some people even argue that there was another lyric change -- where Barrett sings \"walk with me\", there's a slight \"f\" sound in his vocal. As someone who does a lot of microphone work myself, it sounds to me like just one of those things that happens while recording, but a lot of people are very insistent that Barrett is deliberately singing a different word altogether:  [Excerpt: The Pink Floyd, \"Candy and a Currant Bun\"]  The A-side, meanwhile, was inspired by real life. Both Barrett and Waters had mothers who used\u00a0 to take in female lodgers, and both had regularly had their lodgers' underwear stolen from washing lines. While they didn't know anything else about the thief, he became in Barrett's imagination a man who liked to dress up in the clothing after he stole it:  [Excerpt: The Pink Floyd, \"Arnold Layne\"]  After recording the two tracks with Joe Boyd, the natural assumption was that the record would be put out on Elektra, the label which Boyd worked for in the UK, but Jac Holzman, the head of Elektra records, wasn't interested, and so a bidding war began for the single, as by this point the group were the hottest thing in London. For a while it looked like they were going to sign to Track Records, the label owned by the Who's management, but in the end EMI won out.  Right as they signed, the News of the World was doing a whole series\u00a0of articles about pop stars and their drug use, and the last of the\u00a0articles talked about The Pink Floyd and their association with LSD, even though they hadn't released a\u00a0record yet. EMI had to put out a press release saying that the group\u00a0were not psychedelic, insisting\"The Pink Floyd are not trying to create\u00a0hallucinatory effects in their audience.\"  It was only after getting signed that the group became full-time professionals. Waters had by this point graduated from university and was working as a trainee architect, and quit his job to become a pop star. Wright dropped out of university, but Mason and Barrett took sabbaticals. Barrett in particular seems to have seen this very much as a temporary thing, talking about how he was making so much money it would be foolish not to take the opportunity while it lasted, but how he was going to resume his studies in a year.  \"Arnold Layne\" made the top twenty, and it would have gone higher had the pirate radio station Radio London, at the time the single most popular radio station when it came to pop music, not banned the track because of its sexual content. However, it would be the only single Joe Boyd would work on with the group. EMI insisted on only using in-house producers, and so while Joe Boyd would go on to a great career as a producer, and we'll see him again, he was replaced with Norman Smith. Smith had been the chief engineer on the Beatles records up to Rubber Soul, after which he'd been promoted to being a producer in his own right, and Geoff Emerick had taken over. He also had aspirations to pop stardom himself, and a few years later would have a transatlantic hit with \"Oh Babe, What Would You Say?\" under the name Hurricane Smith:  [Excerpt: Hurricane Smith, \"Oh Babe, What Would You Say?\"]  Smith's production of the group would prove controversial among some of the group's longtime fans, who thought that he did too much to curtail their more experimental side, as he would try to get the group to record songs that were more structured and more commercial, and would cut down their improvisations into a more manageable form. Others, notably Peter Jenner, thought that Smith was the perfect producer for the group.  They started work on their first album, which was mostly recorded in studio three of Abbey Road, while the Beatles were just finishing off work on Sgt Pepper in studio two. The album was titled The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, after the chapter from The Wind in the Willows, and other than a few extended instrumental showcases, most of the album was made up of short, whimsical, songs by Barrett that were strongly infused with imagery from late-Victorian and Edwardian children's books.  This is one of the big differences between the British and American psychedelic scenes. Both the British and American undergrounds were made up of the same type of people -- a mixture of older radical activists, often Communists, who had come up in Britain in the Ban the Bomb campaigns and in America in the Civil Rights movement; and younger people, usually middle-class students with radical politics from a privileged background, who were into experimenting with drugs and alternative lifestyles.  But the\u00a0 social situations were different. In America, the younger members of the underground were angry and scared, as their principal interest was in stopping the war in Vietnam in which so many of them were being killed. And the music of the older generation of the underground, the Civil Rights activists, was shot through with influence from the blues, gospel, and American folk music, with a strong Black influence. So that's what the American psychedelic groups played, for the most part, very bluesy, very angry, music,  By contrast, the British younger generation of hippies were not being drafted to go to war, and mostly had little to complain about, other than a feeling of being stifled by their parents' generation's expectations. And while most of them were influenced by the blues, that wasn't the music that had been popular among the older underground people, who had either been listening to experimental European art music or had been influenced by Ewan MacColl and his associates into listening instead to traditional old English ballads, things like the story of Tam Lin or Thomas the Rhymer, where someone is spirited away to the land of the fairies:  [Excerpt: Ewan MacColl, \"Thomas the Rhymer\"]  As a result, most British musicians, when exposed to the culture of the underground over here, created music that looked back to an idealised childhood of their grandparents' generation, songs that were nostalgic for a past just before the one they could remember (as opposed to their own childhoods, which had taken place in war or the immediate aftermath of it, dominated by poverty, rationing, and bomb sites (though of course Barrett's childhood in Cambridge had been far closer to this mythic idyll than those of his contemporaries from Liverpool, Birmingham, Newcastle, or London).  So almost every British musician who was making music that might be called psychedelic was writing songs that were influenced both by experimental art music and by pre-War popular song, and which conjured up images from older children's books. Most notably of course at this point the Beatles were recording songs like \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" and \"Penny Lane\" about places from their childhood, and taking lyrical inspiration from Victorian circus posters and the works of Lewis Carroll, but Barrett was similarly inspired.  One of the books he loved most as a child was \"The Little Grey Men\" by BB, a penname for Denys Watkins-Pitchford. The book told the story of three gnomes,\u00a0 Baldmoney, Sneezewort, and Dodder, and their adventures on a boat when the fourth member of their little group, Cloudberry, who's a bit of a rebellious loner and more adventurous than the other three, goes exploring on his own and they have to go off and find him. Barrett's song \"The Gnome\" doesn't use any precise details from the book, but its combination of whimsy about a gnome named Grimble-gromble and a reverence for nature is very much in the mould of BB's work:  [Excerpt: The Pink Floyd, \"The Gnome\"]  Another huge influence on Barrett was Hillaire Belloc. Belloc is someone who is not read much any more, as sadly he is mostly known for the intense antisemitism in some of his writing, which stains it just as so much of early twentieth-century literature is stained, but he was one of the most influential writers of the early part of the twentieth century. Like his friend GK Chesterton he was simultaneously an author of Catholic apologia and a political campaigner -- he was a Liberal MP for a few years, and a strong advocate of an economic system known as Distributism, and had a peculiar mixture of very progressive and extremely reactionary ideas which resonated with a lot of the atmosphere in the British underground of the time, even though he would likely have profoundly disapproved of them.  But Belloc wrote in a variety of styles, including poems for children, which are the works of his that have aged the best, and were a huge influence on later children's writers like Roald Dahl with their gleeful comic cruelty. Barrett's \"Matilda Mother\" had lyrics that were, other than the chorus where Barrett begs his mother to read him more of the story, taken verbatim from three poems from Belloc's\u00a0Cautionary Tales for Children -- \"Jim, Who Ran away from\u00a0his Nurse, and was Eaten by a Lion\", \"Henry King (Who chewed bits of\u00a0String, and was cut off in Dreadful Agonies)\", and \"Matilda (Who Told\u00a0Lies and Was Burned to Death)\" -- the titles of those give some idea of the kind of thing Belloc would write:  [Excerpt: The Pink Floyd, \"Matilda Mother (early version)\"]  Sadly for Barrett, Belloc's estate refused to allow permission for his poems to be used, and so he had to rework the lyrics, writing new fairy-tale lyrics for the finished version.  Other sources of inspiration for lyrics came from books like the I Ching, which Barrett used for \"Chapter 24\", having bought a copy from the Indica Bookshop, the same place that John Lennon had bought The Psychedelic Experience, and there's been some suggestion that he was deliberately trying to copy Lennon in taking lyrical ideas from a book of ancient mystic wisdom. During the recording of Piper at the Gates of Dawn, the group continued playing live. As they'd now had a hit single, most of their performances were at Top Rank Ballrooms and other such venues around the country, on bills with other top chart groups, playing to audiences who seemed unimpressed or actively hostile.  They\u00a0also, though made two important appearances. The more well-known of these was\u00a0at the 14-Hour Technicolor Dream, a benefit for International Times magazine with people including Yoko\u00a0Ono, their future collaborator Ron Geesin, John's Children, Soft\u00a0Machine, and The Move also performing. The 14-Hour Technicolor Dream is now largely regarded as *the* pivotal moment in the development of the UK counterculture, though even at the time some participants noted that there seemed to be a rift developing between the performers, who were often fairly straightforward beer-drinking ambitious young men who had latched on to kaftans and talk about enlightenment as the latest gimmick they could use to get ahead in the industry, and the audience who seemed to be true believers.  Their other major performance was\u00a0at an event called\u00a0\"Games for May -- Space Age Relaxation for the Climax of Spring\",\u00a0where they were able to do a full long set in a concert space with a quadrophonic sound system, rather than performing in the utterly sub-par environments most pop bands had to at this point. They came up with a new song written for the event, which became\u00a0their second single, \"See Emily Play\".  [Excerpt: The Pink Floyd, \"See Emily Play\"]  Emily was apparently always a favourite name of Barrett's, and he even talked with one girlfriend about the possibility of naming their first child Emily, but the Emily of the song seems to have had a specific inspiration. One of the youngest attendees at the London Free School was an actual schoolgirl, Emily Young, who would go along to their events with her schoolfriend Anjelica Huston (who later became a well-known film star). Young is now a world-renowned artist, regarded as arguably Britain's greatest living stone sculptor, but at the time she was very like the other people at the London Free School -- she was from a very privileged background, her father was Wayland Young, 2nd Baron Kennet, a Labour Peer and minister who later joined the SDP. But being younger than the rest of the attendees, and still a little naive, she was still trying to find her own personality, and would take on attributes and attitudes of other people without fully understanding them,\u00a0 hence the song's opening lines, \"Emily tries, but misunderstands/She's often inclined to borrow somebody's dream til tomorrow\".  The song gets a little darker towards the end though, and the image in the last verse, where she puts on a gown and floats down a river forever *could* be a gentle, pastoral, image of someone going on a boat ride, but it also could be a reference to two rather darker sources. Barrett was known to pick up imagery both from classic literature and from Arthurian legend, and so the lines inevitably conjure up both the idea of Ophelia drowning herself and of the Lady of Shallot in Tennyson's Arthurian poem, who is trapped in a tower but finds a boat, and floats down the river to Camelot but dies before the boat reaches the castle:  [Excerpt: The Pink Floyd, \"See Emily Play\"]  The song also evokes very specific memories of Barrett's childhood -- according to Roger Waters, the woods mentioned in the lyrics are meant to be woods in which they had played as children, on the road out of Cambridge towards the Gog and Magog Hills.  The song was apparently seven minutes long in its earliest versions, and required a great deal of editing to get down to single length, but it was worth it, as the track made the top ten.  And that was where the problems started.  There are two different stories told about what happened to Roger Barrett over the next forty years, and both stories are told by people with particular agendas, who want particular versions of him to become the accepted truth. Both stories are, in the extreme versions that have been popularised, utterly incompatible with each other, but both are fairly compatible with the scanty evidence we have. Possibly the truth lies somewhere between them.  In one version of the story, around this time Barrett had a total mental breakdown, brought on or exacerbated by his overuse of LSD and Mandrax (a prescription drug consisting of a mixture of the antihistamine diphenhydramine and the sedative\u00a0methaqualone, which was marketed in the US under the brand-name Quaalude), and that from late summer 1967 on he was unable to lead a normal life, and spent the rest of his life as a burned-out shell.  The other version of the story is that Barrett was a little fragile, and did have periods of mental illness, but for the most part was able to function fairly well. In this version of the story, he was neurodivergent, and found celebrity distressing, but more than that he found the whole process of working within commercial restrictions upsetting -- having to appear on TV pop shows and go on package tours was just not something he found himself able to do, but he was responsible for a whole apparatus of people who relied on him and his group for their living. In this telling, he was surrounded by parasites who looked on him as their combination meal-ticket-cum-guru, and was simply not suited for the role and wanted to sabotage it so he could have a private life instead.  Either way, *something* seems to have changed in Barrett in a profound way in the early summer of 1967. Joe Boyd talks about meeting him after not having seen him for a few weeks, and all the light being gone from his eyes.  The group appeared on Top of the Pops, Britain's top pop TV show, three times to promote \"See Emily Play\", but by the third time Barrett didn't even pretend to mime along with the single. Towards the end of July, they were meant to record a session for the BBC's Saturday Club radio show, but Barrett walked out of the studio before completing the first song.  It's notable that Barrett's non-cooperation or inability to function was very much dependent on circumstance. He was not able to perform for Saturday Club, a mainstream pop show aimed at a mass audience, but gave perfectly good performances on several sessions for John Peel's radio show The Perfumed Garden, a show firmly aimed at Pink Floyd's own underground niche. On the thirty-first of July, three days after the Saturday Club walkout, all the group's performances for the next month were cancelled, due to \"nervous exhaustion\". But on the eighth of August, they went back into the studio, to record \"Scream Thy Last Scream\", a song Barrett wrote and which Nick Mason sang:  [Excerpt: Pink Floyd, \"Scream Thy Last Scream\"]  That was scheduled as the group's next single, but the record company vetoed it, and it wouldn't see an official release for forty-nine years. Instead they recorded another single, \"Apples and Oranges\":  [Excerpt: Pink Floyd, \"Apples and Oranges\"]  That was the last thing the group released while Barrett was a member.  In November 1967 they went on a tour of the US, making appearances on American Bandstand and the Pat Boone Show, as well as playing several gigs. According to legend, Barrett was almost catatonic on the Pat Boone show, though no footage of that appears to be available anywhere -- and the same things were said about their performance on Bandstand, and when that turned up, it turned out Barrett seemed no more uncomfortable miming to their new single than any of the rest of the band, and was no less polite when Dick Clark asked them questions about hamburgers.  But on shows on the US tour, Barrett would do things like detune his guitar so it just made clanging sounds, or just play a single note throughout the show. These are, again, things that could be taken in two different ways, and I have no way to judge which is the more correct. On one level, they could be a sign of a chaotic, disordered, mind, someone dealing with severe mental health difficulties. On the other, they're the kind of thing that Barrett was applauded and praised for in the confines of the kind of avant-garde underground audience that would pay to hear AMM or Yoko Ono, the kind of people they'd been performing for less than a year earlier, but which were absolutely not appropriate for a pop group trying to promote their latest hit single.  It could be that Barrett was severely unwell, or it could just be that he wanted to be an experimental artist and his bandmates wanted to be pop stars -- and one thing absolutely everyone agrees is that the rest of the group were more ambitious than Barrett was. Whichever was the case, though, something had to give.  They cut the US tour short, but immediately started another British package tour, with the Jimi Hendrix Experience, the Move, Amen Corner and the Nice. After that tour they started work on their next album, A Saucerful of Secrets.  Where Barrett was the lead singer and principal songwriter on Piper at the Gates of Dawn, he only sings and writes one song on A Saucerful of Secrets, which is otherwise written by Waters and Wright, and only appears at all on two more of the tracks -- by the time it was released he was out of the group. The last song he tried to get the group to record was called \"Have You Got it Yet?\" and it was only after spending some time rehearsing it that the rest of the band realised that the song was a practical joke on them -- every time they played it, he would change the song around so they would mess up, and pretend they just hadn't learned the song yet.  They brought in Barrett's old friend Dave Gilmour, initially to be a fifth member on stage to give the band some stability in their performances, but after five shows with the five-man lineup they decided just not to bother picking Barrett up, but didn't mention he was out of the group, to avoid awkwardness. At the time, Barrett and Rick Wright were flatmates, and Wright would actually lie to Barrett and say he was just going out to buy a packet of cigarettes, and then go and play gigs without him.  After a couple of months of this, it was officially announced that Barrett was leaving the group. Jenner and King went with him, convinced that he was the real talent in the group and would have a solo career, and the group carried on with new management. We'll be looking at them more in future episodes.  Barrett made a start at recording a solo album in mid-1968, but didn't get very far. Jenner produced those sessions, and later said\u00a0\"It seemed a good idea to go into the studio because I knew he\u00a0had the songs. And he would sometimes play bits and pieces and you\u00a0would think 'Oh that's great.' It was a 'he's got a bit of a cold\u00a0today and it might get better' approach. It wasn't a cold -- and you\u00a0knew it wasn't a cold -- but I kept thinking if he did the right\u00a0things he'd come back to join us. He'd gone out and maybe he'd come\u00a0back. That was always the analogy in my head. I wanted to make it feel\u00a0friendly for him, and that where we were was a comfortable place and\u00a0that he could come back and find himself again. I obviously didn't\u00a0succeed.\"  A handful of tracks from those sessions have since been released, including a version of \u201cGolden Hair\u201d, a setting by Barrett of a poem by James Joyce that he would later revisit:  [Excerpt: Syd Barrett, \u201cGolden Hair (first version)\u201d]  Eleven months later, he went back into the studio again, this time with producer Malcolm Jones, to record an album that later became The Madcap Laughs, his first solo album. The recording process for the album has been the source of some controversy, as initially Jones was producing the whole album, and they were working in a way that Barrett never worked before. Where previously he had cut backing tracks first and only later overdubbed his vocals, this time he started by recording acoustic guitar and vocals, and then overdubbed on top of that.  But after several sessions, Jones was pulled off the album, and Gilmour and Waters were asked to produce the rest of the sessions. This may seem a bit of a callous decision, since Gilmour was the person who had replaced Barrett in his group, but apparently the two of them had remained friends, and indeed Gilmour thought that Barrett had only got better as a songwriter since leaving the band.  Where Malcolm Jones had been trying, by his account, to put out something that sounded like a serious, professional, record, Gilmour and Waters seemed to regard what they were doing more as producing a piece of audio verite documentary, including false starts and studio chatter. Jones believed that this put Barrett in a bad light, saying the outtakes\u00a0\"show Syd, at best as out of\u00a0tune, which he rarely was, and at worst as out of control (which,\u00a0again, he never was).\" Gilmour and Waters, on the other hand, thought that material was necessary to provide some context for why the album wasn't as slick and professional as some might have hoped.  The eventual record was a hodge-podge of different styles from different sessions, with bits from the Jenner sessions, the Jones sessions, and the Waters and Gilmour sessions all mixed together, with some tracks just Barrett badly double-tracking himself with an acoustic guitar, while other tracks feature full backing by Soft Machine.  However, despite Jones' accusations that the album was more-or-less sabotaged by Gilmour and Waters, the fact remains that the best tracks on the album are the ones Barrett's former bandmates produced, and there are some magnificent moments on there. But it's a disturbing album to listen to, in the same way other albums by people with clear talent but clear mental illness are, like Skip Spence's Oar, Roky Erickson's later work, or the Beach Boys Love You. In each case, the pleasure one gets is a real pleasure from real aesthetic appreciation of the work, but entangled with an awareness that the work would not exist in that form were the creator not suffering. The pleasure doesn't come from the suffering -- these are real artists creating real art, not the kind of outsider art that is really just a modern-day freak-show -- but it's still inextricable from it:  [Excerpt: Syd Barrett, \"Dark Globe\"]  The Madcap Laughs did well enough that Barrett got to record a follow-up, titled simply Barrett. This one was recorded over a period of only a handful of months, with Gilmour and Rick Wright producing, and a band consisting of Gilmour, Wright, and drummer Jerry Shirley. The album is generally considered both more consistent and less interesting than The Madcap Laughs, with less really interesting material, though there are some enjoyable moments on it:  [Excerpt: Syd Barrett, \"Effervescing Elephant\"]  But the album is a little aimless, and people who knew him at the time seem agreed that that was a reflection of his life. He had nothing he *needed* to be doing -- no\u00a0 tour dates, no deadlines, no pressure at all, and he had a bit of money from record royalties -- so he just did nothing at all. The one solo gig he ever played, with the band who backed him on Barrett, lasted four songs, and he walked off half-way through the fourth.  He moved back to Cambridge for a while in the early seventies, and he tried putting together a new band with Twink, the drummer of the Pink Fairies and Pretty Things, Fred Frith, and Jack Monck, but Frith left after one gig. The other three performed a handful of shows either as \"Stars\" or as \"Barrett, Adler, and Monck\", just in the Cambridge area, but soon Barrett got bored again.  He moved back to London, and in 1974 he made one final attempt to make a record, going into the studio with Peter Jenner, where he recorded a handful of tracks that were never released. But given that the titles of those tracks were things like\u00a0\"Boogie #1\", \"Boogie #2\", \"Slow Boogie\", \"Fast Boogie\",\u00a0\"Chooka-Chooka Chug Chug\" and \"John Lee Hooker\", I suspect we're not missing out on a lost masterpiece.  Around this time there was a general resurgence in interest in Barrett, prompted by David Bowie having recorded a version of \"See Emily Play\" on his covers album Pin-Ups, which came out in late 1973:  [Excerpt: David Bowie, \"See Emily Play\"]  At the same time, the journalist Nick Kent wrote a long profile of Barrett, The Cracked Ballad of Syd Barrett, which like Kent's piece on Brian Wilson a year later, managed to be a remarkable piece of writing with a sense of sympathy for its subject and understanding of his music, but also a less-than-accurate piece of journalism which led to a lot of myths and disinformation being propagated.  Barrett briefly visited his old bandmates in the studio in 1975 while they were recording the album Wish You Were Here -- some say even during the recording of the song \"Shine On, You Crazy Diamond\", which was written specifically about Barrett, though Nick Mason claims otherwise -- and they didn't recognise him at first, because by this point he had a shaved head and had put on a great deal of weight. He seemed rather sad, and that was the last time any of them saw him, apart from Roger Waters, who saw him in Harrod's a few years later. That time, as soon as Barrett recognised Waters, he dropped his bag and ran out of the shop.  For the next thirty-one years, Barrett made no public appearances. The last time he ever voluntarily spoke to a journalist, other than telling them to go away, was in 1982, just after he'd moved back to Cambridge, when someone doorstopped him and he answered a few questions and posed for a photo before saying\u00a0\"OK! That's enough, this\u00a0is distressing for me, thank you.\"  He had the reputation for the rest of his life of being a shut-in, a recluse, an acid casualty. His family, on the other hand, have always claimed that while he was never particularly mentally or physically healthy, he wasn't a shut-in, and would go to the pub, meet up with his mother a couple of times a week to go shopping, and chat to the women behind the counter at Sainsbury's and at the pharmacy. He was also apparently very good with children who lived in the neighbourhood.  Whatever the truth of his final decades, though, however mentally well or unwell he actually was, one thing is very clear, which is that he was an extremely private man, who did not want attention, and who was greatly distressed by the constant stream of people coming and looking through his letterbox, trying to take photos of him, trying to interview him, and so on. Everyone on his street knew that when people came asking which was Syd Barrett's house, they were meant to say that no-one of that name lived there -- and they were telling the truth. By the time he moved back, he had stopped answering to \"Syd\" altogether, and according to his sister\u00a0\"He came to hate the name latterly, and what it meant.\"  He did, in 2001, go round to his sister's house to watch a documentary about himself on the TV -- he didn't own a TV himself -- but he didn't enjoy it and his only comment was that the music was too noisy. By this point he never listened to rock music, just to jazz and classical music, usually on the radio. He was financially secure -- Dave Gilmour made sure that when compilations came out they always included some music from Barrett's period in the group so he would receive royalties, even though Gilmour had no contact with him after 1975 -- and he spent most of his time painting -- he would take photos of the paintings when they were completed, and then burn the originals.  There are many stories about those last few decades, but given how much he valued his privacy, it wouldn't be right to share them. This is a history of rock music, and 1975 was the last time Roger Keith Barrett ever had anything to do with rock music voluntarily.  He died of cancer in 2006, and at his funeral there was a reading from The Little Grey Men, which was also quoted in the Order of Service -- \"The wonder of the world, the beauty and the power, the shapes of things, their colours lights and shades; these I saw. Look ye also while life lasts.\u201d  There was no rock music played at Barrett's funeral -- instead there were a selection of pieces by Handel, Haydn, and Bach, ending with Bach's Allemande from the Partita No. IV in D major, one of his favourite pieces:  [Excerpt: Glenn Gould, \"Allemande from the Partita No. IV in D major\"]  \u00a0As they stared blankly in dumb misery deepening as they slowly realised all they had seen and all they had lost, a capricious little breeze, dancing up from the surface of the water, tossed the aspens, shook the dewy roses and blew lightly and caressingly in their faces; and with its soft touch came instant oblivion. For this is the last best gift that the kindly demi-god is careful to bestow on those to whom he has revealed himself in their helping: the gift of forgetfulness. Lest the awful remembrance should remain and grow, and overshadow mirth and pleasure, and the great haunting memory should spoil all the after-lives of little animals helped out of difficulties, in order that they should be happy and lighthearted as before. Mole rubbed his eyes and stared at Rat, who was looking about him in a puzzled sort of way. \u201cI beg your pardon; what did you say, Rat?\u201d he asked. \u201cI think I was only remarking,\u201d said Rat slowly, \u201cthat this was the right sort of place, and that here, if anywhere, we should find him. And look! Why, there he is, the little fellow!\u201d And with a cry of delight he ran towards the slumbering Portly. But Mole stood still a moment, held in thought. As one wakened suddenly from a beautiful dream, who struggles to recall it, and can re-capture nothing but a dim sense of the beauty of it, the beauty! Till that, too, fades away in its turn, and the dreamer bitterly accepts the hard, cold waking and all its penalties; so Mole, after struggling with his memory for a brief space, shook his head sadly and followed the Rat."

It becomes a powerful meditation tool.   We recommend that you use this for atleast once a day, and meditate along with it.

Being a despot is hard work and sometimes you need cheering up...that\u2019s why he challenged Abbe De Baigne, a builder of things, to create a brand new musical instrument for his amusement... The result was the piganino, a keyboard that required a number of pigs of varying sizes...each was laid out on a flat surface, smallest to largest...above the hind end of each pig was a spike connected to a piano-like keyboard...by pressing a key, the corresponding pig would be spiked, resulting in an oink of a certain note...it was thus possible to play a tune by poking the pig... It didn\u2019t sound very good, but it worked and Louis XI found it very funny...the pigs did not... Music and technology have always had an interesting relationship...sometimes it\u2019s harmonious and wonderfully...other times\u2014like with the piganino\u2014there\u2019s a hideous clash... ...however, the piganino, invented 600 years ago, was the forerunner of future music-related technologies like sample, sequencing, and synthesis...the tech\u2014or at least some of the concepts\u2014would eventually win out... If we step back and look at the history of science, math, and engineering and the practice of creating the art music, we\u2019ll see that every time the two intersect, technology almost always comes out the winner...and that\u2019s okay... Something that seems radical, evil, transgressive, impure, and corrupting turns out to be a pretty good deal and music is the better for it...

And finally, there\u2019s this:... \u201ccould what happened to that person happen to me?\u201d...again, totally normal... When it comes to the death of a famous musician, there\u2019s an additional aspect to processing the news...chances are we never knew this person as, you know, a person...our only relationship with them has been as a fan...so why does their death affect us?... Here\u2019s a possible answer...although we never knew them, it was through their music that we learned more about ourselves...and in a way, when they die, a little of us dies, too... This might only cause us to go deeper into what happened...we just need to know, to make sense if it, and to put everything to rest the best we can...yes, some people get very nosey and gossipy and intrusive, but there\u2019s always a way to handle what\u2019s known through the public record: family statements, doctors\u2019 accounts, police reports, coroners\u2019 testimony, toxicology examinations, and autopsy results.... And we often can\u2019t look away because we just need to know...this is \u201cthe last moments of, part 2\u201d.... Learn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices"

That\u2019s completely natural...whenever we\u2019re met with something incomprehensible, we demand an explanation...sometimes one comes quickly...other times, it takes days, weeks, months, and even years for the truth to come out\u2014if at all...\u00a0 And how much are we entitled to know?...when do we cross the line from being curious and concerned to gawking and prurient and prying and invading very private space?... Yet there is something to be said for learning about how someone died...maybe there\u2019s a lesson to be learned or a cautionary tale, steps we or someone else can take to make sure something like this never happens again\u2014or at least not as often... A celebrity death is news, part of the public record...and wanting to know what happened helps us process the news and all the emotions that go along with such a death... Besides, some will say, these doomed people are celebrities...and as celebrities, they lived with the idea that the public was interested in multiple aspects of their existence, including how they died...it goes with the territory... And one other thing: could we ourselves ever meet such an end?...

In some songs, the beat is subtle but there...you feel it without someone having to keep it for you...but in others, you need a timekeeper, someone to emphasize and augment and the beats and the rhythms... For centuries, that job has fallen to drummers and percussionists...but what if a drummer or percussionist isn\u2019t available?...or if you want to try something rhythmic but with different sounds, sounds that a drummer can\u2019t make?...then you might find yourself reaching for a drum machine... Since their introduction in the very early 1980s, drum machines have become an essential part of modern compositions and productions...in fact, it\u2019s impossible to imagine the music we have today without such electronic devices... Oh, we still have human drummers\u2014we always will\u2014but drum machines have taken us places that human timekeepers never could...and I\u2019m speaking as someone who plays drums myself...

        "episode_description": "For centuries, there\u2019s been a dance between music and technology with each affecting the other in some way...almost always, though, there\u2019s no fighting progress...music (and everything to do with it) ultimately bends to the needs and demands of new technology... For example, when the Catholic Church built big, echo-y cathedrals in the Middle Ages, the sacred music in those buildings adapted to this new architecture so that it made use of the natural reverb... Fast-forward a bunch of centuries...Thomas Edison\u2019s talking machine, first demonstrated in 1877, and Emile Berliner\u2019s gramophone, which debuted 10 years later, were the first machines able to capture sound, up to three minutes at a time...but because of that recording limit, the standard length of a popular song became about three minutes...the music bent to the limitations of the medium... I can give you other examples: radio changed the way music was consumed, marketed and sold...jukeboxes help spread the word on R&B, country, and rock\u2019n\u2019roll...they were so popular that a coin shortage in 1937 was blamed on the popularity of jukeboxes... Electricity gave us amplifiers and the electric guitar...the microphone turned singers from people who could belt out tunes at high volumes into crooners who used the mic to create softer, more intimate performances... Synthesizers were reviled by many musicians at first because one could make the sounds of an entire orchestra, threatening the livelihoods of professionals...but they were eventually accepted...sampling was thought to be evil and illegal at first, but we worked that out...file-sharing of mp3s meant that no one would ever pay for music again, but now hundreds of millions of people are paying for streaming...there\u2019s more, but you get what I\u2019m talking about... This music-and-tech balance continues today...and on episode five of our look at rock in the 2010s, we\u2019re going to look how that particular dance played out and the effect these interactions had on our music...

        "episode_description": "It\u2019s an established fact that music comes in many different types of cycles...a sound and style will be big for a while, reach a peak with the public, and then slowly fade out....but once established, it\u2019s unusual for a sound to completely disappear, never to be heard from again... The only genre I can think of is---maybe alt-rock-style rockabilly...it was big in the very early 80s with bands like the stray cats...but then it just kinda went away...there\u2019s never been a rockabilly revival\u2014at least in the sense and style and scope of what we heard way back then when it was huge for about 18 months... Instead, after enjoying a time at the forefront of music, many of the cycle-prone rock sounds recede into the shadows, never really going away...they lie in wait until someone comes along\u2014often a generation or two later\u2014to rediscover and reactivate it... When that happens, it\u2019s usually given a sonic update and if the timing is right, the sound enjoys a new period of time in sun before the cycle repeats yet again... The longer you live and the more music you become familiar with, the more you begin to see these cycles play themselves out, sometimes over and over again...we see it every decade... The 2010s were no different...we saw a series of revivals, rediscoveries, and comebacks, all based on the musical dna of what had come before...let\u2019s examine that...this is the history of the 2010s, part 4...

What began as a spark in the early 50s turned out to be the musical equivalent of the cosmological big bang...and as the years and decades passed, this music\u2014which began as a fresh take on the 12-bar blues template\u2014separated, segmented, stratified, mutated,\u00a0evolved\u2014with increasing speed... New genres began to appear yearly, monthly, and sometimes even weekly...today, it seems like every single day results in some kind of derivative spin-off sub-sub-sub-sub-genre... The new sound and approach may gain traction and stay with us for some time, perhaps even carving out its own permanent space in the rock universe...more likely, though, a new genre will have a half-life shorter than hydrogen 7...and to save you from looking that up, that\u2019s a tiny, tiny fraction of a second: a decimal point followed by 23 zeroes... But there\u2019s no stopping the fission and fusion of rock...we\u2019re always going to get new sounds...keeping up with them all is another matter... This is part of what makes writing a musical history of the 2010s so challenging...the number of iterations rock went through in that decade was insane...but if we\u2019re going to understand what happened to rock during that time, we\u2019re going to have to at least try...

Here\u2019s something you may not have know...at last estimate, about 95,000 songs are uploaded to the streaming music services every day...of that number, only about 4% are from those three majors...the rest is from indie labels and do-it-yourself musicians... Let me flip that around: 96% of all new music comes from independent musicians...the market share of indie labels has been rising by double-digits for almost 25 years now... Indie music\u2014or at least material from bands not directly signed to one of the three majors\u2014was an important aspect of the 2010s...major label acts were still important, but without the indies, it would have been a pretty empty decade...but thanks to the sheer volume of new music and some crafty distribution by indie-friendly companies, we got to hear a lot of it... The width and breadth of indie over those ten years was staggering...and without the influence of independent musicians, styles, and trends, major label mainstream rock would have been much different...

Take the 60s, for example...this sounds a bit weird at first, but they didn\u2019t end when the calendar flipped over to January 1, 1970...decades have momentum\u2014sometimes a hangover\u2014that carries things forward for a year or two or even three afterwards... For example, the 50s carried on until probably 1963...it took the assassination of JFK to really kick off the new decade...historians have made convincing arguments that the 60s didn\u2019t end until 1972-ish... The 70s may have ended relatively on time, brought about by things like the death of disco, a terrible recession, the election of Ronald Reagan, and other markers that said the \u201cme decade\u201d of 70s were done... I\u2019d say that the 80s ended by the end of 1991, thanks to the first gulf war, another awful recession, and a wholesale sea change in music as we quickly transitioned from a world awash in hair metal to the new alternative generation... I\u2019d put the end of the 90s in 2001..buried by 9/11 and the retaliation that followed, the rise of the internet, the bursting of the dot-com bubble, and the end of the traditional music industry, the introduction of the iPod... The aughts?...that\u2019s another decade that I feel ended on time...so much came to a screaming halt with the financial crisis\u2014the great recession in 2008\u2014and by the time the clouds parted, we were done with that decade... This leaves us at the dawn of the 2010s which was one of the few decades that started right on time...and for the next 10 years, we saw everything from prosperous economic growth to the rise of authoritarism...and technology?...wow...the 2010s saw more people get into tech and gadgets than at any time in history...smart phones, the explosion of social media, cord-cutting...

        "episode_description": "My topic is about what kids now-a-days listen to and their opinions on songs. This is important because everyone has different interests in music and people get inspired from different songs. A lot of people have songs that mean a lot to them because it reminds them of something or someone. This topic is also entertaining to kids because they might like the song that's being talked about or have a different opinion. It's also interesting to me because music is such a big topic that people have their own ideas and thoughts about different songs and I wonder what they are. Music genres have changed throughout different generations. You wouldn\u2019t hear anyone now listening to music from the 1900s. Even though people now have different music tastes, they still fall into bigger categories of music genres. So what do kids now-a-days actually listen to? I plan to interview a few kids at our school. For example, some people I can interview are Ina, Kami, Senia, etc. I plan to interview kids at school or kids who are in the same age range as me because my podcast is about what kids listen to. I am choosing a specific age group for the interviews (unless I\u2019m comparing for the podcast) because each generation listens to different music genres and it would make it more realistic if I wasn't comparing. I think the topic about music is already entertaining enough especially if popular/liked songs are being played. The purpose of the podcast is to find out what kids listen to and their opinions on different songs. It\u2019s almost like a debate that will kinda keep them interested because they want to say their opinion. I will also try not to keep it boring, for example I would add background music, lots of interviews, and talking to the listeners. "

Since 2015, acclaimed Texas-based singer/songwriter Justin Gambino has been developing an enthusiastic following across the United States and around the world with his charismatic live performances and hope-filled anthems. With an EP, a full-length\u00a0recording,\u00a0and numerous cinematic music videos to his credit, Gambino\u2019s signature\u00a0songs\u00a0include \u201cYour Hands & Feet,\u201d \u201cAnchored\u201d and \u201cGoing Under.\u201d He\u2019s performed at festivals, churches, camps and other venues, opening for such genre leaders as TobyMac, for KING +\u00a0COUNTRY, Crowder, Casting Crowns, Skillet and Switchfoot.\u00a0Gambino\u2019s testimony is a consistent theme in his music and ministry. A rebellious teen, he was arrested for theft at the age of 18. Opting for military enlistment and community service in lieu of incarceration, he spent eight years in the US Navy. While serving in Iraq, Gambino was asked to lead worship on base, rekindling a love for music he first embraced as a child. Battling PTSD and anger issues following his military service, Gambino turned to alcohol and spiraled into depression and despair. One night, on the floor of his apartment,\u00a0he cried out to God for help and a new journey of redemption, hope and purpose began. Coming full circle, Gambino now holds the Brazoria County Revival each year on the steps of the Texas courthouse where he was sentenced as a teen.  Made New, the second full-length studio recording from acclaimed singer/songwriter Justin Gambino, is now available everywhere. Tracing his prodigal years and the abounding grace and mercy Gambino embraced when he finally returned to the Father,\u00a0Made New\u00a0was produced by Nashville-based session player and producer Walter Halliwell.\u00a0      ---   Send in a voice message: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/christianmusicguys/message"

        "episode_description": "On today's Friday edition, we chat with Grace Graber! In many ways, Grace Graber is the voice of a rising movement full of people who believe that maybe both faith and mental health matter \u2014 in fact, maybe they\u2019re inextricably intertwined. \u00a0 With a pop-punk sound in the playful yet heartfelt tradition of Avril Lavigne, Grace\u2019s musical message runs in tandem with her viral social media presence. Her candid conversations about mental health, music, and her faith resonate with followers who immediately feel a kinship with her genuine heart. Part of that authenticity stems from the fact that Grace Graber has lived a journey very similar to her listeners. \u00a0 \u201cThis ministry, the rest of my music, none of this is about me,\u201d Grace is quick to say. \u201cIt\u2019s about what God wants to do in His people, specifically through mental health. That\u2019s an epidemic right now. We need to be talking about it more. I\u2019m not doing music for me, to get on radio, to get signed. I\u2019m doing music to save lives.\u201d \u00a0 Not too long ago, Grace Graber was a suicidal teenager struggling with PTSD from severe bullying. Music gave her the ability to survive\u2014 specifically, a Hawk Nelson song that met her where she was. In a glorious full-circle moment, Hawk Nelson\u2019s founding vocalist Jason Dunn would later feature on Grace\u2019s song \u201cThis One\u2019s For You,\u201d a track from the Conversations EP that was written for anyone in a place like the one she walked through. \u00a0 \u201cI feel like God opened more doors to healing,\u201d Grace reflects. \u201cIt was like opening up a wound and forcing myself to feel some trauma that I didn't realize I could still feel. Now that I have a therapist and a team, now that I\u2019ve done this collaboration and I'm in a healthy place, I'm able to find resolution to it all for my teenage self, who is content and happy and feels valued.\u201d \u00a0 Songs like \u201cThe Light\u201d and \u201cDo It For Me\u201d speak to some of that possibility of healing, with Grace being fixed on the core message: \u201cif God can do it for me, He can do it for anybody.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0Her latest single, 'Superficiality' is out now! gracegraber.com @gracegrabermusic christianmusicguys.com @christianmusicguys  ---   Send in a voice message: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/christianmusicguys/message"

While most Christian artists begin at their church and then move on, Fellowship Creative is still serving every Sunday at their home church, Fellowship Church. It is there that they reflect the heart of their Pastor, Ed Young, to creatively and passionately introduce people to Jesus. These stories of life change continue to inspire the music of Fellowship Creative. Their most recent project, \u201cTil The Day I Die,\u201d comes from a chapter of grief and loss over the tragic death of friend, family, and team member, LeeBeth Young, the oldest daughter of Ed & Lisa Young. Her death opened up a chapter of asking God tough questions and really working out what it means to trust Jesus. The church was where they processed their pain, and this experience inspired these songs of honest vulnerability, deep introspection, and a renewed level of faith. \u00a0Every song and artist has a message they want to share. For Fellowship Creative, its simple - Jesus is the hope of the world. And they\u2019ll be writing songs, serving in their church, and spreading that message \u2018til the day they die. Their latest album, 'The Help Project\", is out now! fellowshipcreative.com @fellowshipcreative christianmusicguys.com @christianmusicguys  ---   Send in a voice message: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/christianmusicguys/message"

Riley Clemmons is a rising artist from Nashville, TN who has accumulated over half a billion global streams and 85 million YouTube video views since the beginning of her almost decade long career. After spending years refining her craft in writers\u2019 rooms, Riley sky-rocketed onto the scene with her 2017 Capitol CMG debut single \u201cBroken Prayers\u201d, which has generated over 56 million global streams since its release. Her 2018 self-titled album debut quickly entered the Billboard Heatseekers chart, debuting at No. 13. \u00a0Riley released her long awaited third studio album,\u00a0Church Pew.   The 11-track album, co-produced with Jeff Pardo, marks a season a self-discovery for Riley. After experiencing depression and burn out brought on by the pressures of being in the spotlight for so long, Riley spent the better part of a year reflecting and finding what brought her true joy. The resulting body of work follows that journey and demonstrates who she is at her core. Though no stranger to the studio, Church Pew, marks the first time Riley has stepped into\u00a0the role of Executive Producer.  \u201cIt feels as though my entire life has been leading up to the creation of this record\u201d shares Riley. \u201cWith that said, this album was born from the lowest and toughest point in my life thus far. During an ongoing battle with depression and anxiety and navigating what felt like a true identity crisis, I took a step back from music and creating to live life. I was able to pause long enough to rediscover what I loved and resonated with sonically and lyrically, as I began to allow myself the space to naturally evolve, change, and grow.\u00a0 rileyclemmons.com @rileyclemmons christianmusicguys.com @christianmusicguys       ---   Send in a voice message: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/christianmusicguys/message"

A Commonwealth Scholar, Dr. Carolyn Weber holds her B.A. Hon. from Huron College at Western University, Canada and her M.Phil. and D.Phil. from Oxford University, England. Dr. Weber is an award-winning author, popular professor and international speaker with talks ranging from campuses world-wide to Billy Graham\u2019s Cove and 100 Huntley Street. She has given numerous radio, television and podcast interviews on the intersection of faith and literature, as well as topics related to women and faith. She has served as faculty at Oxford University, Seattle University, University of San Francisco, Westmont College, Brescia University College and Heritage College and Seminary. She was the first female dean of St. Peter\u2019s College, Oxford. Dr. Weber recently relocated to the Nashville, TN area to work more closely with its special creative community dedicated to faith and the arts. She is delighted to serve as a professor at New College Franklin in Franklin, TN, where she is grateful to be part of the rich fellowship of learning at this unique and wonderful college. Carolyn Weber\u2019s first memoir,\u00a0Surprised by Oxford\u00a0(Thomas Nelson/Harper Collins) won among other distinctions the Grace Irwin Award, the largest award for Christian writing in Canada.\u00a0Holy is the Day: Living in the Gift of the Present\u00a0(InterVarsity Press) was short listed for the same prize, and won the faith living category. Surprised by Oxford\u00a0is the incredible true story of Caro Drake, a young, headstrong American who lands a coveted scholarship to the University of Oxford for her postgraduate studies. Burdened with trust issues and intellectually hostile towards the abstract, Caro begins her time in Oxford with the singular goal of attaining her PhD. But through a tempestuous friendship with a charming young man and the wise counsel of the college\u2019s first female provost, Caro begins to open herself up to mystery, vulnerability, and the possibility of love. Surprised by Oxford\u00a0invites audiences into a world of romance, reason, and high calling. The true-life story of college-aged American Caro Drake is a wonder-filled exploration of life\u2019s beauty and complexity, experienced in a manner not entirely dissimilar to C.S. Lewis\u2019s famous awakening nearly a century ago in the hallowed halls of Oxford, England.

Little does he know this camp is run by the notorious Falco (Christopher Lloyd) and his dog Lazarus who both despise technology and have a short temper when it comes to children. Thankfully there are kind and optimistic camp leaders like Jake (Corbin Bleu) to help guide him and cheer him up. Although Noah is extremely pessimistic upon arrival, he begins to soften and create bonds with some of the other kids at camp. He learns some valuable lessons in integrity, faith, and friendship which is helpful when the bad guys show up looking for him and their missing item. The camp kids band together in a Home Alone style funhouse in the woods with boobie traps ranging from slick decks with zip lines at the lake to huts filled with bees. In the end, Falco steps up to help the kids and they all learn a valuable lesson in sticking together.

        "episode_description": "Green noise is a type of sound that is similar to white noise, but with a slightly different frequency spectrum. It is often described as a gentle, flowing sound that can help you relax and unwind. Green noise blocks inconsistent bedroom sounds, such as street noise, and induces relaxation, leading to better sleep quality. Unlike white noise, green noise sounds more natural, resembling rain or waves. Green noise can be used as a background sound to better focus while reading, studying, or doing homework. It is also a great way to fight intrusive thoughts and worries while trying to meditate or fall asleep. The 8+ hours of deep green noise will continue uninterrupted (after the intro and ads) ensuring you stay asleep all night and wake up fully rested and recovered.

Then, out of nowhere, the ride suddenly ended. \"What went wrong?\" is the obvious question to ask, here, but it's not the right one. We need to talk about who went wrong. The answer nearly everyone's accepted for going on 40 years now is demonstrably untrue but we can only learn the truth through a deep dive on the country music record industry of the 1960s and by taking a look at how the careers of 2 international pop stars built a throne for The King of Broken Hearts."

Ever wonder why so many people will never trust the government or politicians? Press play. Ever wonder if the \"moonshine\" you can now buy in liquor stores is really moonshine?

Check it out if you're interested!\u00a0  Guess who's coming to town this holiday season? No, it's not Santa, it's Jim Carrey's iconic Grinch from the 2000 film, \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas!\" We had the pleasure of bantering with Broadway's Andrew Keenan-Bolger, who once donned green fur as JoJo and young Max in the stage rendering of this tale. We strolled down memory lane, reminiscing about our own connections with Carrey as the green grouch, and Andrew spilled the beans about a special screening, and his Grinch stint that surprisingly didn't draw from Carrey's interpretation. Spoiler Alert: The film's marketing blitzkrieg and its ripple effects on all things Grinch were quite a chat fodder.  Now who can speak of the Grinch without diving into the nitty-gritty of its making? From Carrey's reluctance to play the Grinch to the Herculean efforts that turned him into the character, we've got the deets for you. We couldn't help gushing about the makeup and visual effects, clearly ahead of their time, but we did pause to discuss whether the film did justice to Dr. Seuss's original masterpiece. Opinions were split, but that's where the fun lies, right? Buckle up as we bring to you a rollercoaster of reviews, a fun game of guessing 'Letterboxd' star ratings, and a face-off between the recent Grinch remake and the original.

Join Chris Molanphy as he explains how Pink defined her own genre fusing punk attitude and soaring melodies into 21st-century self-empowerment music.

Our Clap It Back this week unusually unusual, even by our standards here at Noodle Loaf.

This song celebrates our roles within our communities and helps develop a child's sense of pitch and rhythm. \u272a  We finish the episode with a Finish The Pattern game all about breakfast.

To celebrate this milestone, we turn the mic around to our listeners and listen to them singing their favorite songs from the show as well as songs that they have written. \u00a0We got kids from all over, like The Bronx, Scotland and New Zealand, singing songs they wrote. \u00a0Anywhere you go in this world kids are making up songs and singing them together because singing together is just about the most humanly \u00a0fundamental thing two people can do. Sometimes folks who write songs get together to do a song share. \u00a0This episode is something like that. \u00a0You'll hear kids sharing their favorite songs from the show, many of them with slight changes either from misheard lyrics or modifications they felt were necessary. \u00a0That is the folk process after all. \u00a0You'll hear families harmonizing, part singing, vocal jamming and riffing back and forth the way families have been doing for centuries. \u00a0And you'll hear some of the most creative and joyful original songs you've every heard, all written and performed by the single digit class. \u00a0Pete Seeger said \"Our Greatest songs are yet unsung.\" \u00a0Well a few of them just got sung. I hope you enjoy them and feel inspired to record a few of your own to share with your friends. \u00a0Thanks for coming to our celebration.

We begin with an Echo Song about being the insatiable desire to take a thing apart to see how it works and then feelings that arise when you realize that putting it back together may not be in the cards. \u00a0This happens in my life more often than I'd care to admit. \u00a0Might as well sing a song about it that promotes pitch awareness in a Gypsy Punk style. \u272a  Perk up your ears in this aural awareness game Name That Sound. \u00a0I will play the audio of various household chores and you must identify them. \u00a0You don't have to identify WITH them. It's not an empathy exercise, just a sound naming game. \u00a0Enjoy! \u272a  And lastly, I take those chore sounds and remix them into a funky groove with which you are encouraged to Jam Along. \u00a0Your body and surroundings become drums in this body percussion and found object percussion activity. Make it funky! \u272a  We hope you enjoy our music and games for preschoolers, kindergarteners and early elementary age kids!\u00a0 It's like a music lesson for kids that encourages household responsibility.  \u272a\u272a\u272a I have written three pictures books celebrating families.

Here are the games on today's show:  First up a Clap It Back game called \"What's On The Menu\" \u00a0I say things that are on the menu. \u00a0You clap back the rhythm of the words. It's fun, easy and helps develop a sense of rhythm. \u00a0If the foods were actually available then it would be a very promising new restaurant concept.\u00a0\u272a  Before today's echo songs you'll hear a brief description of how some songs are written which will help demystify how an instant classic like Funky Little Porcupine comes to be. It's not rocket science. \u00a0It's much fancier. \u272a  We end with a Call and Response written by the eternal Ella Jenkins. \u00a0The song is called Dulce Dulce and it is a fun music game that will help your child learn rhythm, melody and the Spanish word \"Dulce.\" \u00a0Ella Jenkins was not Hispanic but hopefully this Spanish word song will inspire some Hispanic Heritage Month singing and playing even as the official celebration month draws to an end. \u272a  We hope you enjoy our music and games for preschoolers, kindergarteners and early elementary age kids!\u00a0 It's like a music lesson for kids you can do on the way to your swimming lesson.

We begin with a Time To Move movement game called Bubble Bubble Pop. \u00a0Kids will use their hands, fingers and claps to perform a dance that develops small motor skills AND big movement thrills. \u00a0\u272a  Nextly, we share a Noodle Loaf version of the Echo Song mega-hit, Down By The Bay. \u00a0This was recorded when Joni was a good bit shorter than she currently is. \u00a0Not to worry, I have adjusted the mic to accommodate her latest height. \u00a0We've added our own punchlines to this song. \u00a0How did we do? \u272a  Who doesn't love a listening skill building game like Name That Sound? I don't want to give away any answers but let's just say you're going to need an extra pair of socks to play this one. \u00a0\u272a  A Tiny Song that is about a Donkey Farm and about how everyone is going there tonight. \u00a0Not too much to add to that. \u272a  We hope you enjoy our music and games for preschoolers, kindergarteners and early elementary age kids!\u00a0 It's like a music lesson for kids you can play at 1.25x speed.

The piano punisher had come for the King of Rock\u2019s crown and was determined to show him up at every turn. Jerry Lee scored a deal on Elvis\u2019 onetime label, employed the same management, and even some of the same songwriters. The pair duked it out in the charts in the late \u201850s, but the image conscious Elvis remained a much bigger crossover star than Jerry Lee, who relished his role as an uncompromising bad boy. When Elvis received his draft notice, Jerry Lee seemed poised to take over as rock\u2019s leading voice. Then it all came crashing down as his troubling private life became public. Exiled from the rock \u2019n\u2019 roll spotlight, Jerry Lee spent much of the \u201860s playing honky tonk dives and slowly rebuilding his musical career. Meanwhile, Elvis effectively abdicated his throne, trading electrifying singles for well-paying yet vapid films. Both men emerged from the wilderness by the end of the decade, spurring each other\u2019s musical efforts. There was a begrudging respect between them, but Jerry Lee\u2019s aggression sometimes got the best of him \u2014\u00a0like the time he showed up at Presley\u2019s Graceland estate late one night with a gun. They didn\u2019t call him \u201cThe Killer\u201d for nothing.  Learn more about your ad-choices at https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.comSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information."

        "episode_description": "Two burgeoning musical geniuses came together in the mid-60s to form the Velvet Underground, a group that expanded the definition of what a rock band could be. Lou Reed\u2019s literary ambitions led him to craft lyrics steeped in the gritty language of the streets, while John Cale called upon his background in the avant garde music scene of downtown Manhattan. Their unique talents coalesced on tracks like \u201cVenus in Furs,\u201d \u201cSister Ray,\u201d and \u201cHeroin,\u201d groundbreaking songs that laid the groundwork for punk, art-rock, and many other genres to come. The Velvet Underground\u2019s historical influence cannot be overstated, but their lack of commercial success led to heightened tensions in the group. Reed felt his dominance challenged by Cale\u2019s musical virtuosity and forced him out of the band, which would never achieve the same level of musical daring. Their prolific solo careers in the \u201970s and beyond bore traces of their ex-partner, as Reed sought to bolster his artistic credentials with noise experiments, while Cale developed his gift for melody and song craft. Ultimately, it was the unexpected death of their estranged one-time benefactor, Andy Warhol, that brought the pair back together to make peace with themselves, their troubled history, and their towering musical legacy.

The Police was a supposed punk band composed of a prog-rock drummer, a jazzy bassist, and a guitarist who was pushing 40. But their unique chemistry (as well as Sting's trove of catchy pop songs) made them among the first acts to really break out during the MTV era. As they gained in popularity, however, they also grew to despise each other\u00a0more and more, especially as Sting sought to take complete control\u00a0of the band.

        "episode_description": "For \u201880s babies, Britney and Christina represent the ultimate fan face-off. Originally friends and co-stars on The Mickey Mouse Club reboot in the early \u201890s, by the decade\u2019s end they were pitted against one another in the press and in the charts. On the surface, the comparisons were obvious. They were two blonde, ex-Disney stars turned pop upstarts, barnstorming Billboard with suggestive ear-candy like \u201c\u2026Baby One More Time\u201d and \u201cGenie in a Bottle.\u201d But a close listen to their discographies reveals a stark contrast between Britney\u2019s bubble-gum electro-pop and Christina\u2019s R&B leanings. As they grew older, their individual expressions of sexuality made them lightning rods for controversy. Soon they were forced into a troubling cultural dichotomy. The Southern-born Britney was portrayed in the media as the \u201cGood Girl\u201d who publicly renounced sex before marriage. The NYC-raised Christina Aguilera made no such proclamations. Her public \u201cBad Girl\u201d reputation was enhanced by songs like \u201cDirrty\u201d that celebrated her sexual agency. For a time, the cultural firestorm threatened to overshadow their massive talent. Now both are recognized as beloved entertainment icons.

But the lead singers of those bands, Morrissey and Robert Smith, hated listening to each other. Starting with an interview in 1984 in which Morrisey expressed his desire to shoot Smith, the rivalry between these two mope-rock kings has been vicious and often extremely hilarious. When it comes to crafting insults about overly sensitive individuals, Don Rickles has nothing on these guys.

Before he joined Van Halen, Sammy Hagar was a journeyman rock howler with a love of fast cars and mind-controlling aliens. In retrospect, most fans prefer the Roth years, but Hagar was at the head of four consecutive no. 1 albums for Van Halen in the late 1980s and early '90s. And he had a true friendship with Eddie Van Halen, until various factors\u00a0\u2014 including the\u00a0Twister\u00a0soundtrack \u2014 conspired against them. But in their prime, Van Hagar sold millions of albums to listeners hungry for synth-heavy power ballads with excellent guitar solos.

        "episode_description": "In tribute to the late Eddie Van Halen, we\u2019re devoting a pair of episodes to the two distinct eras of his namesake band. The first installment explores the guitar virtuoso\u2019s relationship with the group\u2019s original frontman, a karate kicking, spandex wearing, hyperactive rock \u2019n\u2019 roll peacock named David Lee Roth. More a musical marriage of convenience than genuine friendship, the sparks between the pair both onstage and in the studio helped make Van Halen the biggest band in the world. But fame inflated their egos, and soon the bandmates were at each other\u2019s throats. Diamond Dave loathed Eddie\u2019s use of synthesizers on the album\u00a01984. The global success of the record \u2014 and the pop crossover smash \u201cJump\u201d \u2014 wasn\u2019t enough to repair their creative rift, and Roth departed Van Halen in 1985 in pursuit of solo stardom and a film career. The band carried on without him, first enlisting Sammy Hagar and (briefly) Gary Cherone, before finally welcoming him back into the fold in 2007 for a series of reunion tours and a new album. Fans rejoiced, but the old tensions were never far from the surface.  Learn more about your ad-choices at https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.comSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information."

But one person who was not a fan of that record initially was the head of Gaye's label, Berry Gordy, the visionary\u00a0founder of Motown. Gordy believed that alienating\u00a0white audiences and deviating from a proven pop-R&B formula\u00a0was commercial poison. But even before\u00a0What's Going On,\u00a0Gaye and Gordy were at odds, playing out a twisted father-son dynamic that Gaye instilled from his own deeply troubled childhood. Over time, Gaye and Gordy's professional squabbles would spill into their personal lives, as Gaye married (and acrimoniously divorced) Gordy's sister Anna.

For years, they had a fruitful partnership: Sumner was the quiet and introspective\u00a0one, and Hook was the gregarious rocker. But as the '80s unfolded, and New Order became one of the era's top indie pop groups, their relationship\u00a0started to break down from clashes over the artistic direction of the band and their incompatible personalities. After 30 years, they finally split up, and the resulting acrimony remains heated to this day.

Then an unknown American named Jimi Hendrix hit London in 1966 and changed the game entirely. Hendrix\u2019s unparalleled playing and explosive style forged a new genre and redefined what it meant to be a guitarist \u2014\u00a0and sent the British boys back to the woodshed. Clapton\u2019s status as London\u2019s top axe-man had been challenged, but their rivalry was mostly a friendly one. Clapton was in awe of Hendrix\u2019s talent and the pair bonded over music and mutual admiration. Hendrix\u2019s tragic passing in 1970 left Clapton devastated. In the 50 years since, the reputations of both men have diverged. Hendrix has been sanctified in death and his immense talent seemingly magnified. Clapton, on the other hand, has been dinged for a series of questionable musical and personal decisions later in life. The question in this episode is not \u201cWho\u2019s the better guitarist?\u201d but rather, \u201cIs it better to burn out or fade away?\u201d  Learn more about your ad-choices at https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.comSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information."

The vocal powerhouses spent much of the '90s duking it out on the charts, breaking records with their multi-octave ranges. Though they publicly buried the hatchet with a high profile duet, their relationship would forever be\u00a0marked by competition. In addition to their supreme talent, both women were bonded by personal struggles that threatened to detail their\u00a0musical careers.

But, this whole time, his whole life, almost, he had this question nagging at him. The question came in the form of a rule in math, NEVER divide by zero. But, why not? Cornell mathematician, and friend of the show, Steve Strogatz, chimes in with the historical context, citing examples of previous provocateurs looking to break the rules of math. And he offers Karim a warning, \u201cIn math we have creative freedom, we can do anything we want, as long as it\u2019s logical.\u201dListen along as Karim\u2019s thought exercise becomes an existential quest, taking us with him, as he delves deeper, and deeper, into Zeroworld.

But when he started to work in the ICU, he slowly realized that sometimes keeping people (and their hopes) alive just prolongs the suffering. He wrote a book arguing that a too-late death is just as bad as a too-early one, and that physicians and the public alike need to get better at accepting the inevitability of death sooner.\u00a0 As the book hit the bestseller list, Blair\u2019s own father got diagnosed with a deadly case of pancreatic cancer. Blair\u2019s every impulse was in direct contradiction of the book he just wrote. What should he do? And how can any of us know when to stop fighting death and when to start making peace with it?Special thanks to Lucie Howell\u00a0and Heather Haley.EPISODE CREDITS:\u00a0 Reported by - Latif NasserProduced by - Simon Adlerwith help from - Alyssa Jeong PerryOriginal music and sound design contributed by - Simon Adlerwith mixing help from - Arianne WackFact-checking by - Natalie Middletonand edited by - Pat Walters EPISODE CITATIONS: Books:\u00a0 Blair Bigham, Death Interrupted: How Modern Medicine is Complicating the Way We Die (https://zpr.io/a33mEMW64X5h) \u00a0 Our newsletter comes out every Wednesday.

When the two men face off in an fMRI machine, the challenge is so unimaginably difficult that one man instantly gives up. But the other achieves a musical feat that ought to be impossible. Reporter Jessica Benko went to Michigan to visit Bob Milne, one of the best ragtime piano players in the world, and a preternaturally talented musician. Usually, Bob sticks to playing piano for small groups of ragtime enthusiasts, but he recently caught the attention of Penn State neuroscientist Kerstin Bettermann, who had heard that Bob had a rare talent: He can play technically challenging pieces of music on demand while carrying on a conversation and cracking jokes. According to Kerstin, our brains just aren't wired for that. So she decided to investigate Bob's brain, and along the way she discovered that Bob has an even more amazing ability\u2014one that we could hardly believe and science can't explain.

        "episode_description": "Could puberty get any more awkward? Turns out, yes. Writer Patrick Burleigh started going through puberty as a toddler. He had pubic hair before he was two years old and a mustache by middle school. All of this was thanks to a rare genetic mutation that causes testotoxicosis, also known as precocious puberty. From the moment he was born, abnormally high levels of testosterone coursed through his body, just as it had in his father\u2019s body, his grandfather\u2019s body, and his great-grandfather\u2019s body. On this week\u2019s episode, Patrick\u2019s premature coming of age story helps us understand just why puberty is so awkward for all of us, and whether and how it helps forge us into the adults we all become.

But when one microbiologist stumbled upon a GIANT virus, hundreds of times bigger than any seen before, all that went out the window.\u00a0 The discovery opened the door not only to a new cast of microscopic characters with names like Mimivirus, Mamavirus, and Megavirus, but also to basic questions: How did we miss these until now? Have they been around since the beginning? What if evolution could go \u2026 backwards?

Along the way we look at how new technologies rub up against long-standing beliefs, and how millions of scientists and doctors failed to see what was right in front (and inside!) of their noses. We also find out how mapping the anatomy of this hidden infrastructure may help solve one of the fundamental mysteries of cancer, and perhaps provide a bridge between ancient and modern medicine.

        "episode_description": "While scouring the Sonoran Desert for objects left behind by migrants crossing into the United States, anthropologist Jason De Le\u00f3n happened upon something he didn't expect to get left behind: a human arm, stripped of flesh. This macabre discovery sent him reeling, needing to know what exactly happened to the body, and how many migrants die that way in the wilderness. In researching border-crosser deaths in the Arizona desert, he noticed something surprising. Sometime in the late-1990s, the number of migrant deaths shot up dramatically and have stayed high since. Jason traced this increase to a Border Patrol policy still in effect, called \u201cPrevention Through Deterrence.\u201d First aired in 2018 and over three episodes, Radiolab investigates this policy, its surprising origins, and the people whose lives were changed forever because of it. Part 3: What Remains\u00a0 The third episode in our Border Trilogy follows anthropologist Jason De Le\u00f3n after he makes a grisly discovery in Arivaca, Arizona. In the middle of carrying out his pig experiments with his students, Jason finds the body of a 30-year-old female migrant. With the help of the medical examiner and some local humanitarian groups, Jason discovers her identity. Her name was Maricela. Jason then connects with her family, including her brother-in-law, who survived his own harrowing journey through Central America and the Arizona desert. With the human cost of Prevention Through Deterrence weighing on our minds, we try to parse what drives migrants like Maricela to cross through such deadly terrain, and what, if anything, could deter them.

Part 2: Hold the Line After the showdown in court with Bowie High School, Border Patrol brings in a fresh face to head its dysfunctional El Paso Sector: Silvestre Reyes. The first Mexican-American to ever hold the position, Reyes knows something needs to change and has an idea how to do it. One Saturday night at midnight, with the element of surprise on his side, Reyes unveils ... Operation Blockade. It wins widespread support for the Border Patrol in El Paso, but sparks major protests across the Rio Grande. Soon after, he gets a phone call that catapults his little experiment onto the national stage, where it works so well that it diverts migrant crossing patterns along the entire U.S.-Mexico Border. Years later, in the Arizona desert, anthropologist Jason de Le\u00f3n realizes that in order to accurately gauge how many migrants die crossing the desert, he must first understand how human bodies decompose in such an extreme environment. He sets up a macabre experiment, and what he finds is more drastic than anything he could have expected. Special thanks to Sherrie Kossoudji at the University of Michigan, Lynn M.

His excuse: Border Patrol. Soon more stories of students getting stopped and harassed by Border Patrol started pouring in. So begins the unlikely story of how a handful of Mexican-American high schoolers in one of the poorest neighborhoods in the country stood up to what is today the country\u2019s largest federal law enforcement agency. They had no way of knowing at the time, but what would follow was a chain of events that would drastically change the US-Mexico border.

And over in the North Atlantic Sea, the water temperature spiked to off-the-chart levels. Some people figured that meant we were about to go over the edge\u2014doomsday. In the face of this, Hank Green (a long time environmentalist and science educator behind SciShow, Crash Course, and more), took to social media to put things in context\u00a0andto keep people focused on what we can do about climate change. In the process, he came across a couple studies that suggested a reduction in sulfurous smog from cargo ships may have accidentally warmed the waters. And while Hank saw a silver lining around those smog clouds, the story he told\u2014about smog clouds and cooling waters and the problem of geoengineering\u2014took us on a rollercoaster ride of hope and terror. Ultimately, we had to wrestle with the question of what we should be doing about climate change, or what we should even talk about.Special thanks to Dr. Colin Carson and Avishay Artsy.

But if we have to actually kill that person ourselves, the math gets fuzzy. That\u2019s the lesson of the classic Trolley Problem, a moral puzzle that fried our brains in an episode we did almost 20 years ago, then updated again in 2017. Historically, the questions posed by The Trolley Problem are great for thought experimentation and conversations at a certain kind of cocktail party. Now, new technologies are forcing that moral quandary out of our philosophy departments and onto our streets. So today, we revisit the Trolley Problem and wonder how a two-ton hunk of speeding metal will make moral calculations about life and death that still baffle its creators.

Los j\u00f3venes estadounidenses enloquecen con un g\u00e9nero musical, el rock and roll, que tambi\u00e9n vuelve locos a sus padres, pero... en un sentido muy diferente. Aquella noche, un avi\u00f3n surca los aires del Medio Oeste.

La singularidad de esta lista, que detalla su autor, Chema S\u00e1nchez, es que no incluye temas de reguet\u00f3n ni de trap. 2021 ha sido un a\u00f1o prol\u00edfico en m\u00fasica, probablemente porque 2020 fue un a\u00f1o en el que muchos m\u00fasicos tuvieron m\u00e1s tiempo para componer, producir y grabar sus creaciones.

Os recomendamos ambos.

Esta narradora de sentimientos os va a abrir de par en par los conductos auditivos gracias a canciones como \"Peque\u00f1a y poco manejable\", \"Lobo\" o \"La jefa del blues\". Desc\u00fabrela con nosotros, porque es una persona con alma, sensible. Pr\u00f3xima. Una voz que pone luz en mitad de un panorama musical casi uniforme y que es siempre complicado de atacar.\u00a0 Su nuevo disco, del que conversamos con ella, tiene de todo: es un compendio de canciones con may\u00fascula.

Jesca Hoop explores her extraordinary story to reveal the life behind the legend.In the first episode, we hear how young Joni loves to watch the trains go by from the window of her house in a Saskatchewan prairie town. Even as a child, there is a desire to see what's around the next bend. She's a tomboy and an athlete, until polio forces her into a period of convalescence; she's no longer picked first for sports teams but when she gets the use of her legs back she rock 'n' roll dances her way through her teens. Her childhood ambition is to be a painter, but when she finally makes it to art school everything changes....\u201cI\u2019ve always been a creature of change\u201d \u2013 Joni MitchellThrough archive, fresh interviews, narration, immersive sound design and an original score, we trace the story of an extraordinary life and explore what makes Joni Mitchell a singular artist: the genius of her lyrics; her incredible talent as guitarist, painter and producer; and her restless drive for innovation.In Legend, we follow Joni from her \u2018flatlander\u2019 childhood on the Canadian prairies, through the folk clubs of Toronto and Detroit, to a redwood cottage in L.A.\u2019s Laurel Canyon, to a cave in Crete, to a deserted desert highway, to recording studios and stages around the world. From her earliest home recordings to masterpieces like Blue, Court and Spark, and Hejira, we explore some of the stories behind her best-loved songs and celebrate her remarkable return to live performance in 2023: \u201clike seeing, in the wild, a rare bird long feared extinct\u201d (Lindsay Zoladz).Our guide through the series is the California-born, Manchester-based musician, Jesca Hoop. Jesca speaks to musicians like Blake Mills, Allison Russell, Holly Laessig and Jess Wolfe, who have played alongside Joni, and we hear tributes from those, like musician John Grant, who have been inspired and influenced by her music. We also hear from friends, including Larry Klein and Graham Nash; and from music critics and biographers, including Ann Powers, David Yaffe, Lindsay Zoladz, Kate Mossman, Barney Hoskyns, Miles Grier and Jenn Pelly.The Joni Mitchell Story comes from the production team behind BBC Radio 4\u2019s award-winning podcast Soul Music \u2013 \u201c\u2026 the gold standard for music podcasts\u2026\u201d (Esquire).Producers: Mair Bosworth and Eliza Lomas Production Coordinator: Andrew Lewis Editor: Chris Ledgard Story Editor: Emma Harding Story Consultant: John Yorke Sound Design and Original Music: Hannis Brown Studio Engineers: Ilse Lademann and Michael Harrison Commissioning Editor: Daniel Clarke"

        "episode_description": "Antonin Dvorak wrote his Gypsy Songs in 1880. He was passionate about the folk music of his native Bohemia and set a poem by Czech poet Adolf Heyduk to music. Songs My Mother Taught Me is the fourth song in the cycle.Songs my Mother taught me In the days long vanished Seldom from her eyelids Were the teardrops banished....It's a wistful melancholic piece evoking memory and loss.  Soul Music hears the stories of musicians, poets and singers from around the world of why they are so drawn to it. The poet Raine Geoghegan is the daughter of a Romany woman whose life was weighed down with the loss of her father at a young age.  Raine identifies with the sadness of the music because it not only represents grief at the loss of her father but also for the loss of a way of life for the gypsy people. For Emily MacGregor it's all about the music we inherit from our parents.  She is writing a book about music and grief and says this piece perfectly represents the bittersweet feeling of listening to music associated with the loss of a loved one.  Dvorak had already lost three children in infancy by the time he wrote his Zigeuner Lieder. Paris based violinist and conductor Bartu Elci-Ozsoy associates Songs with the innocence of childhood and was moved to perform it at a benefit concert he organised in aid of the children affected by the devastating earthquake in his native Turkey and Syria in early 2023. The Korean soprano Sumi Jo recorded it in honour of her mother and presented it to her a year before she died in gratitude for her determination to see her daughter become a professional singer. When The Scotsman newspaper commissioned a series of lockdown concerts in Spring 2020 cellist Sua-Lee chose to recreate the concert  by Beatrice Harrison a century earlier when she played the piece accompanied by nightingales in her garden in Surrey.  Sua set up her cello in woodland near her home in Grantown- on-Spey and performed Songs My Mother Taught Me to a collection of woodland creatures Singer Ruby Hughes performed the American composer Charles Ives' version of the piece for a collection called Bright Travellers - music curated and composed by Helen Grimes from poems by Fiona Benson.  Ives wrote his own version of Dvorak's piece not long after the Czech composer had settled in America.   She loves the rocking gentle lullaby sensation created by the lilting melodies of both Ives' and Dvorak's compositions.Featuring additional recordings by Sua Lee and Zoe ChallenorProducer: Maggie Ayre"

It became a huge hit and Miriam Makeba used newfound fame to speak the injustices of apartheid.  Her records were banned and South Africa and she was forced to live in exile.  Here, people from around the world share their stories about what this iconic track means to them.Actor John Kani grew up in Johannesburg remembers dancing to the song when it came on the radio and says that Miriam Makeba became an inspiration for how art could bring about change.  He would meet her years later after a concert in New York, and again in Johannesburg after apartheid ended. Author of 'Makeba: the Miriam Makeba Story', Nomsa Mwamuka, charts the history of 'Pata Pata' and why Makeba would come to see it as \"frivilous\".Buks van Heerden is a pace-runner who has completed over 800 marathons.  He plays 'Pata Pata' late in the race when the runners he's pacing are getting tired and says it always lifts the mood.Angelique Kidjo says Miriam Makeba was the first African woman on the cover of an album.  Hearing 'Pata Pata' inspired her to perform, and later in life she and Makeba became friends.Dr. Niyi Coker devised 'Mama Africa: The Musical' in Cape Town when he realised that a younger generation of South Africans weren't aware of Miriam Makeba of her work.  'Pata Pata' would see two generations of 'Miriam' singing together and it would bring the house down.Produced for BBC Audio Bristol by Toby Field Technical Producer: Ilse Lademann Editor: Emma HardingWith thanks to Rita Ray, Dr. Niyi Coker, and Moses Molapisane at the BBC bureau in Johannesburg."

        "episode_description": "Wicked the musical is 20 years old in 2023. The story of the Wizard of Oz told from the witches' perspective examines themes of difference, power and alienation. The so called Wicked Witch of the West Elphaba born with green skin experiences the pain of growing up different and of longing for acceptance. No surprise then that anybody who has ever felt marginalised or that they don't fit in is drawn to her story.  Defying Gravity is Elphaba's war-cry at the end of Act One as she bravely decides to forge her own path in life - to \"close her eyes and leap\". The song has become a powerful anthem for people from all different walks of life and this episode tells some of their stories. Edward Pierce the Broadway set designer of Wicked knows the song through and through as he worked on the sequence where Elphaba takes flight and begins Defying Gravity.  It wasn't until he became severely ill with Covid that the song took on a different meaning.  While he was in an induced coma on a ventilator a nurse sang and hummed Defying Gravity to him.  He believes that song played more than a minor role in his recovery. That nurse was singer Felicia Temple who had featured on The Voice America singing talent show performing Defying Gravity. When her musical career was cut short by lockdown in March 2020 she returned to nursing and when she found herself at the bedside of a Broadway set designer there was only one song that came to mind.  But it has a personal resonance for her too as she went onto that TV show to sing the song one year on from her own illness with cancer and was resolute that as the song goes 'nothing was ever going to bring me down'. The first British singer to play the role of Elphaba in the West End and Broadway is Kerry Ellis.  She recounts how that song has given her so much in life and how grateful she is to its strong message of courage. Kath Pierce formerly of the Manchester Proud Choir outlines why Defying Gravity is such an important song to the LGTBQ community and why the choir and members of the public took to the trams and streets of Manchester one November evening in defiance of a violent attack against two young gay men. They'd been on their way home on the tram singing songs from Wicked after a night out.  Hundreds of people assembled in the city centre and sang Defying Gravity as a protest against the hate crime. Musicologist Mel Spencer talks us through the genius of composer Stephen Schwartz's song and how it harks back to Somewhere Over The Rainbow as well as to Wagner!Producer: Maggie Ayre"

It was released in April 1988, and that summer, the American singer-songwriter performed it to a global audience of 600 million at Nelson Mandela's 70th Birthday Tribute. This broadcast catapulted Tracy and the song to super-stardom, as it became a top ten hit on both sides of the Atlantic and received three Grammy nominations. Ever since, 'Fast Car' has resonated with people around the world. The lyrics describe a working woman trying to escape a cycle of poverty, dreaming of a plan to leave in a \"fast car\". She speaks of wanting to get out of the life she finds herself in, living in a shelter, and driving towards the city to find something better.

        "episode_description": "When Burt Bacharach and lyricist Hal David wrote I Say A Little Prayer For You in 1967 the war in Vietnam was raging. The song was intended as message of support for the soldiers there.  It was originally recorded by Dionne Warwick and the following year by Aretha Franklin. Doug Bradley was drafted and served in Vietnam as a war correspondent. He says the music the troops all listened to on AFVN (Armed Forces Vietnam Network) sustained him and others while they were in country.  His book We Gotta Get Out of This Place (The Soundtrack of the Vietnam War) documents the vital role music played for the soldiers.  Aretha Franklin was a symbol of hope and civil rights for many African American troops and I Say A Little Prayer a soothing and calming message of love. The singer-songwriter Rumer adored the song and all of Aretha's music as an unhapy teenager in England. She went on to write the hit song Aretha about a young girl whose mother has a mental illness confiding all her worries to the Queen of Soul.  Her husband Rob Shirakbari was recruited by both Dionne Warwick and Burt Bacharach as keyboard player and musical arranger. To him the song with its mixture of time signatures and different interpretations symbolises many happy years playing with two of the musical greats. Jazz singer Nnenna Freelon has recorded two versions of because it is one she has loved throughout the years but only after the death of her husband Phil in 2019 did it become a song about the expression of grief.  Her latest version interprets the song as a plea and a prayer for her late husband as well as for herself.  Her podcast Great Grief is a meditation on grief and loss combined with music. In 1968 Aretha Franklin played in Stockholm.  15 year old Hasse Huss and his friend hung around her hotel hoping to meet her.  Not only did they meet her but at her invitation they spent the next day with her as she rehearsed for her show.  I Say A Little Prayer fills him with happiness and nostalgia for this happy day in the late sixties and he plans to incorporate the song lyrics into a speech for his son's wedding. And Professor Daphne Brooks grew up with older siblings and musical parents who introduced her to the song. It has been with her throughout her life representing for her the 'fullness of black womanhood'.  The song very recently helped her deal with her beloved mother's passing at the age of 96.Producer: Maggie Ayre"

It was released in June 1981 as riots were springing up around the UK and with the help of an iconic video it topped the UK singles charts.  It was also be the band's final single.  Writer Alex Wheatle first heard 'Ghost Town' in 1981 whilst in a social services hostel in Brixton awaiting his court appearance.  He'd been arrested following a day of action in Brixton to protest against racist treatment of Black people, after rumours of police brutality.  He was sentenced to one year in prison and sang 'Ghost Town' in his cell, as he began to find hope and purpose in his life.Claire Horton grew up in Dudley and says 'Ghost Town' echoed her experiences of watching the shops and nightclubs of this once vibrant town closing down.  Her Dad was made redundant and it had a huge impact on her family, and as a young police officer she would walk the streets and understand why people were getting so frustrated with their situation.  Soul and Reggae DJ Dave Marshall Barrett traces the history of The Specials who formed in Dave's hometown of Coventry in 1977.  It's the first thing people mention when he says where he comes from.John Collins was surprised when Jerry Dammers asked him to produce the record.  John created the initial opening 'ghostly' sounds on a synth at home but he says they now sound more like sirens.  The song's success opened doors for John and he loves how it keeps finding new audiences.Broadcaster Samira Ahmed grew up in London and said her the recession of the early 80s hit her family's catering business hard.  Too young for nightclubs, she remembers the video of 'Ghost Town' playing on Top of the Pops and says the track made a huge impact on her understanding of music and politics.Jazz singer Beverley Beirne covered 'Ghost Town' for her 2018 album 'Jazz Just Wants to Have Fun' and was reminded of it during the first lockdown when she wasn't able to perform.Founder of The Specials Jerry Dammers reflects on the inspiration behind 'Ghost Town' and how trombonist Rico Rodriguez was the heart and soul of the band.Producer: Toby Field Additional research: Melanie Pearson Technical Producer: Michael Harrison Editor: Emma Harding"

        "episode_description": "When I Only Have Eyes For You first emerged in 1934 it was a jaunty ditty written by Harry Dubin and Al Warren for the movie \"Dames\".  But it gained huge popularity when the 1950s doo wop group The Flamingos under the musical arrangement of Terry Johnson transformed it into a dreamy otherworldly love song.  Terry explains how he went about turning the song into an evergreen hit that has been covered by many including Art Garfunkel and Carly Simon. Musicologist Luis Cruz attributes the genius of the song to its pedal chord - the repeated use of the C note. It adds to the feeling of fixation he says where the singer cannot see anyone else but the object of his affection. The song is obviously one that speaks of deep love and Vivian Fransen was one of many who chose the song to play at her wedding.  She'd been introduced to the Art Garfunkel version in 1975 when she met the man who was to become her husband. 12 years later he revealed a secret he'd been keeping from her which ended their marriage and caused her to reassess the song's meaning. Jess Farr Cox would sing the song to her aged rescue dog Pico as his health deteriorated.  Only that song and the theme to Antiques Roadshow would send him to sleep  when he was in pain and distress and she still gets emotional when she hears it over a year after he was eventually put to sleep. People underestimate the love you get from a rescue dog, she says. Chris Deerin is a political journalist and part of Scottish band Fat Cops.  He recorded a version of I Only Have Eyes For You for the Tiny Changes Young People's Mental Health Charity founded following the death of the singer Scott Hutchison in 2018.  Chris says he and fellow musician Bobby Bluebell had always loved the song and felt it was a fitting tribute to fellow musician Scott.Producer: Maggie Ayre"

        "episode_description": "Some people say it's a protest song about the commercialisation of Christmas. Others that it's anti-religious. I Believe In Father Christmas is about neither, although lyricist Peter Sinfield concedes that it does include a touch of cynicism but says ultimately it's a song of joy and hope. When Greg Lake co-wrote it in 1975 he had embarked on a solo career away from Emerson Lake & Palmer.  Those around him at the time, including songwriter Peter Sinfield and broadcaster Bob Harris, recall how repeating a simple acoustic guitar exercise led Greg Lake to this giant of a song that includes a full choir, orchestra, and an extract from Prokofiev to create an enduring Christmas anthem.  For many people it's a comforting song conjuring images of nostalgic picture postcard Christmases of a childhood spent in the ambience of Christmas tree lights and candles with 'eyes full of tinsel and fire'.  For others it's a cautionary reminder of the need to look beyond the materialism and commercialism to a quieter, more spiritual  time.Producer: Maggie Ayre"

Singing my life with his words...\" Killing Me Softly with His Song is a song about the pleasure and embarrassment of being seen. The feeling that someone has reached into your deepest, most private feelings, and laid them bare: \"I felt he'd found my letters, and read each one out loud\". It's a song about a singer, and about what music can do. And it's a love song that feels at once happy and sad. The song was a huge hit in two different generations. It won Grammy Awards for The Fugees in 1997 and for Roberta Flack in 1974. Ray Padgett, author of Cover Me: The Stories Behind the Greatest Cover Songs of All Time, unfolds the layers of the song's history as a famous cover of a famous cover. The musicologist Nate Sloan explores what the song does harmonically, oscillating between major and minor chords to create a sense of uncertainty and longing. And Lori Lieberman tells the story of the Don McLean concert that inspired her lyrics for the song, that she was the first to record as a young singer-songwriter in 1972.  It's a song that transports Tiff Murray back to the hot New York summer of 1996, when the Fugees version blared from every car radio and shopfront. For her it was the soundtrack to falling in love while far from home. It's also a love song for Julie Daley, but now with a sharp edge. Dr Robin Boylorn listened to the Fugees version as a self-conscious teenager and felt a flush of recognition; Ben heard it the Christmas he first came to the UK from South Africa, played by a busker early one morning in Covent Garden as the first snow he'd ever seen began to fall; and Perminder Khatkar has treasured the song since it played in the delivery room during the birth of her first child.Produced by Mair Bosworth for BBC Audio in Bristol"

Its full title 'Oi u luzi chervona kalyna' translates as 'Oh the red viburnum in the meadow': red viburnum is a common plant in Ukraine and in the song it's a metaphor for the country itself.Telling their stories on Soul Music: Taras Ratushnyy, journalist turned soldier, discusses his beloved son, Roman, and the heroic role he played in Ukrainian society both before after the war began.Elizaveta Izmalkova is a young Ukrainian singer who now lives in Lithuania.

During the voyage, the ship stopped at Halifax, Nova Scotia, where Britten came across a poetry anthology in a bookshop - The English Galaxy of Shorter Poems. In his cabin, he began work on setting some of these poems for voices and harp. Originally conceived as a series of unrelated songs, the piece developed into an extended choral composition for Christmas.There are some pieces of music we return to at special moments and, for many, Britten's A Ceremony of Carols is a beloved winter piece - \"Christmas wouldn't be Christmas without a performance of it\" says harpist Sally Pryce, who recalls performing the piece in deepest winter, desperately trying to keep her fingers warm as she prepared to play the first harp notes. Music writer Gavin Plumley tells the story of Britten's wartime voyage home and reflects on Christmases past and present. Matt Peacock remembers a very special performance of the work bringing together professional musicians, choristers and people experiencing homelessness in an Oxford college chapel. Dr Imani Mosley reflects on how the piece has helped her create a winter ritual in sunny Florida and how its meaning has changed since losing her partner. Conductor and composer Graham Ross is Director of Music at Clare College, Cambridge; he takes us deep into Britten's sound world and reflects on the genius of his approach to setting texts and the mastery of his writing for harp and voices. And Johanna Rehbaum remembers the joy of singing the work with the women of her choir, days before giving birth to her son.Produced in Bristol by Mair Bosworth for BBC Audio"

I have taken the final credit music and blurred it into something peaceful and reflective to listen to while falling asleep. If you haven't seen the show before from 1995, I highly suggest checking it out.\u00a0This line is a metaphorical expression that symbolizes the idea of cleansing and renewal. Misato suggests that taking a bath is not just about physical cleanliness but also a way to cleanse one's mind and soul. Similar to how a washing machine cleanses and refreshes clothes, bathing is portrayed as a rejuvenating process for the individual. It reflects the series' focus on personal growth, healing, and finding solace amidst the emotional turmoil experienced by the characters.Music and sound was recorded by Matt Ridenour exclusively for Sleep BetterContact: Email me at sleepbetterpodcast@gmail.com"

        "episode_id": "7ECohd5VsFcyZfJjnVw1ou",
        "episode_description": "Sleeping with pink noise can offer several benefits for relaxation and improved sleep quality. Here are some of the advantages:Enhanced Sleep: Pink noise is a type of sound that contains equal energy per octave, meaning it has a balanced frequency spectrum. This balanced sound can help mask disruptive noises in your environment, such as traffic or loud neighbors, allowing you to fall asleep faster and stay asleep throughout the night.Improved Focus: Pink noise has been shown to improve focus and concentration. It creates a steady and consistent background sound that can help drown out distractions, making it beneficial for individuals who need to concentrate on tasks, study, or work in noisy environments.Stress Reduction: Pink noise has a soothing effect on the brain, helping to reduce stress and anxiety. The gentle and calming sound can promote relaxation, lower the production of stress hormones, and create a more peaceful sleep environment.Brainwave Synchronization: Pink noise has been linked to promoting brainwave synchronization, particularly in the delta frequency range. Delta waves are associated with deep sleep and relaxation. When your brain synchronizes with these frequencies, it can lead to a deeper and more restorative sleep.Tinnitus Relief: People with tinnitus, a condition characterized by ringing or buzzing sounds in the ears, may find relief by using pink noise. The constant and soothing sound of pink noise can help mask the tinnitus noise, providing some relief and making it easier to fall asleep.Overall Sleep Quality: By promoting relaxation, masking background noises, and encouraging deep sleep, pink noise can contribute to an overall improvement in sleep quality. This can lead to waking up feeling more refreshed, energized, and mentally sharp.It's important to note that individual experiences with pink noise may vary, and it may not be equally effective for everyone. Some people may prefer other types of sounds or find different methods more beneficial for their sleep. It's always a good idea to experiment and find what works best for your personal sleep preferences.Music and sound was recorded by Matt Ridenour exclusively for Sleep BetterContact: Email me at sleepbetterpodcast@gmail.com"

And this is a special one\u2026 Lewis Howes, the OG Podcaster, joins the household in answering your burning questions. Dating, relationships, exes\u2026 All of it. Before getting to our callers, we dive deep into Lewis\u2019 journey from living in New York, moving to LA for a girl, healing through therapy, and conquering 10 years of podcasting. We then get to our callers.\u00a0 Our first caller\u2019s friend is a \u2018straight\u2019 man who drives hours to stay with him, buys sentimental gifts, and sends him heart-eye emojis. He\u2019s not sure if this friend is merely affectionate, or if he\u2019s hinting at a romantic chemistry. Should he risk asking for clarity, for the potential of losing this connection. Our second caller is a mom and daughter duo. The daughter calls in to help decide if her mom\u2019s 4 year partner is losing interest, or if he has become a red flag. For example, he doesn\u2019t trust her mom, and thinks she's being flirty with other men. Our final caller is struggling to move on from his ex, who cheated on him TWICE. After cheating on him with his roommate, moving in with him into a new apartment, she then cheats on him again, with a classmate. Our caller is unsure how to mentally move on and reclaim control over his personal living space. \u201cWhen people want to be with you, they choose you fully. They create space in their life.\u201d\u00a0 Start your 7 Day Free Trial of Viall Files + here: https://viallfiles.supportingcast.fm/\u00a0 Please make sure to subscribe so you don\u2019t miss an episode and as always send in your relationship questions to asknick@theviallfiles.com to be a part of our Monday episodes.\u00a0 To Order Nick\u2019s Book Go To: https://www.viallfiles.com\u00a0 If you would like to get some texting advice on Office Hours send an email to asknick@theviallfiles.com with \u201cTexting Office Hours\u201d in the subject line!\u00a0 To advertise on the show, contact sales@advertisecast.com or visit https://www.advertisecast.com/TheViallFiles\u00a0 THANK YOU TO OUR SPONSORS: Zocdoc - Go https://www.zocdoc.com/VIALL and download the Zocdoc app for FREE.

Before getting to our callers, we discuss disenfranchised men and whether or not there\u2019s a divide between young men and women in modern dating? We then get to our callers.\u00a0 Our first caller is wondering whether a lot of little things add up to a non-negotiable, or is that Girl Math, because she\u2019s considering ending her marriage. She\u2019s not sure whether her grievances with her husband are pet-peeves or a deeper underlying issue in their relationship, and wants to know if it\u2019s a marriage worth fighting for. Our second caller wants to get back together with the love of her life, but he\u2019s currently dating the girl her ex cheated on her with. They broke up because of infidelity on her part, but she feels she\u2019s worked on herself and is ready to start fresh with him. However, is it too late? Our final caller is wondering whether she should shoot her shot with a guy who has a boyfriend. She initially met him at a time when she was in a relationship, but remembers having instant chemistry with him. She\u2019s now single, and wondering if she should reconnect with him, despite his relationship status.\u00a0 \u201cYou can\u2019t base the rest of your life on someone\u2019s potential.\u201d\u00a0 Start your 7 Day Free Trial of Viall Files + here: https://viallfiles.supportingcast.fm/\u00a0 Please make sure to subscribe so you don\u2019t miss an episode and as always send in your relationship questions to asknick@theviallfiles.com to be a part of our Monday episodes.\u00a0 Join us for our new LIVE show on Thursdays at 9PM ET/6PM PT on Amp, available in the Apple app store and https://www.onamp.com for Android listeners.

Brian Funk Episode Transcript: Brian Funk: Hello everybody and welcome to the Music Production Podcast. I'm your host, Brian Funk. And on today's show, I have JP Rendy and Cat Rayo Rendy of Earworm Music and they do a lot of cool stuff. Congratulations, first of all, they just won an Emmy for the song, Friends With a Penguin that they wrote for Billy Porter. That was, what a catchy song and fun. Great job guys, JP Rende: Thank Brian Funk: congrats. JP Rende: you, Kat Raio Rende: Thanks. JP Rende: thank you, thank you. Brian Funk: They write for Sesame Street, Gabby's Dollhouse, Princess Power, Baby Shark's Big Show, Barbie's Dreamhouse Adventure. There's a long list of stuff they do. They do a lot of work for kids in animated TV and film commercials. I love the Charmin, Shiny Hiny song they have. That Kat Raio Rende: Ha Brian Funk: was Kat Raio Rende: ha Brian Funk: great. Kat Raio Rende: ha. JP Rende: Hahaha Brian Funk: A lot of fun. Kat, you've sang with Alicia Keys, Mary J. Blige, Usher, Ray Charles. A lot of really impressive stuff. You guys are doing great work and it sounds like you're having fun. You've married your music and your lives together. So Kat Raio Rende: Yeah. Brian Funk: it's a really unique combination and I'm very excited to talk to you guys. I had a lot of fun digging into your catalog a bit, getting ready for the show. JP Rende: Sweet, thank Brian Funk: Welcome. JP Rende: you. Kat Raio Rende: Thanks. Brian Funk: So, first of all, congratulations on the Emmy. That's great. JP Rende: Oh, thank you. Brian Funk: That must've JP Rende: Yeah, Brian Funk: been JP Rende: that Brian Funk: a real JP Rende: was Brian Funk: treat. JP Rende: really fun. That was a really fun night. Kat Raio Rende: That was a wild time. JP Rende: Yeah, we didn't think we were gonna win, honestly, because we've been nominated before and it's really a crap shoot. You never know. You really never know how the cards fall. And I remember the first time that we went out to the ceremony, maybe it's just a little bit of arrogance. Of course we got this. We got this. Brian Funk: Hehehe Kat Raio Rende: This is JP Rende: It's Kat Raio Rende: Sesame Street. JP Rende: a great song. Ah, we lost. And it felt so bad. It felt, you know, I'm gonna give it real. A lot of people are like, oh, it doesn't matter. It felt bad to lose. So when we got nominated again, we went out with like, hey, it's probably not gonna happen. Let's just have a great time. And we were up against a Ben Folds song. And it was a really good song. Like, Ben Folds, I don't know you, but I wanna know you and you're fantastic. It was called Kat Raio Rende: little things. JP Rende: The Little Things Charlie Brown. It was for Charlie Brown's special. So I Brian Funk: Oh JP Rende: was Brian Funk: wow. JP Rende: like, he's gonna win, it's all good. And then when Jojo Siwa called Friends With a Penguin, we were shocked. Like, full on that meme with Taylor Swift like this. We were totally shocked and it was a really fun thing. And you know, the song, as silly as it can come across on the surface, has a much deeper meaning about, you know, just say hi to somebody that's different than you and you can become friends and don't be afraid of anything that's dissimilar because that's how we learn from each other. Brian Funk: Is that the Emmy behind you, Kat? I see. Kat Raio Rende: I know, I was trying to cover it up because I don't want it to look like a douche. I'm sorry, I don't want it to look like a jerk, but Brian Funk: No, that's great. Kat Raio Rende: yeah. Brian Funk: You should Kat Raio Rende: So. Brian Funk: have that proudly displayed. Kat Raio Rende: Ah ha Brian Funk: Yeah, Kat Raio Rende: ha! Brian Funk: that's awesome. JP Rende: Yeah, sorry, I have one too. It's not in my studio. I gave it to my parents. And partially I was like, you know what? I'm just gonna look at that and become complacent. So I always gotta stay hungry, so. Brian Funk: Yeah, yeah, right. That's a big part of it. You know, you mentioned being silly. And this is like something I kind of wanted to talk to you guys about because there's, I think, a different mindset that goes into writing songs like this compared to like being an artist. You know what I mean? Like Kat Raio Rende: Yes. Brian Funk: a serious artist. So just to give you a sense of where I'm coming from with this. I have my serious artist side, Kat Raio Rende: Hehehe Brian Funk: where I write my songs and stuff. But a few years back with a friend of mine, we wrote songs kind of directed for kids with special needs, specifically autism, for social behavior stuff. And it's called social story songs. And that's something that's often used to help teach proper behavior in places, restaurants, how to interact with people. We had a song similar. to the concept of yours, the perfect greeting for who I'm meeting. So it just teaches JP Rende: Oh Brian Funk: you Kat Raio Rende: Yes! Brian Funk: how JP Rende: wow. Brian Funk: to say hello and stuff. But what I found with that was it was very liberating to write in that way where you didn't have to be so artistic about everything and so serious about it. I had a lot of fun with that. And I wanted to ask you guys a little bit about just that mindset and that way of writing and getting free to be silly with it a little bit and have fun with the songwriting process. Kat Raio Rende: That is the most fun that I think that you can possibly have, especially when it comes to like, I'm neurodivergent and like writing from that perspective and writing, there's like that is a really great, it's a really good place to come from, but also like a really great way to like get all of that out. You know, like you said, like being an artist, I started off as an artist and And it's just not as much fun. It's so much fun writing for like to be silly. And like, you know, there are some artists that do it now. And there's, especially for like, you know, they're for kids movies, but like the recent Barbie movie had a song by Lizzo that I thought was so funny. Like it started off as, I did not write it, but it was a song that was. the first time it came around, it was very serious and happy. And the second time around, it started getting panicked because Barbie was changing as a person. And, JP Rende: Poiler alert. Kat Raio Rende: spoiler alert, sorry. But it's so fun to write like that because like, as writing for kids and knowing their parents are also watching it, it's so fun to like, add adult content in it. Like, we wrote a song for Baby Shark's big show called call me Billiom and where Billiom, Baby Shark's best friend, was trying to be an adult and he said I'm not William now from now on call me Billiom and then the song is like this very serious like rap song and there was like a funny little I don't know if it's an Easter egg but for the adults where it's like I have a cute sign in my living room that says live splash love I'm Billiom it's like You can get to the parents, the silly side of the parents. It brings out the silly side of the parents too. And it's so fun to like add like, I love puns, adding Brian Funk: Uh... Kat Raio Rende: puns and I dream of fish puns. But it's so fun to add, I JP Rende: True Kat Raio Rende: do. JP Rende: story. Kat Raio Rende: I wake up in the middle of the night and like, JP, I'll be right back, I gotta go. Sometimes I'll like go hide Brian Funk: Thanks Kat Raio Rende: in Brian Funk: for Kat Raio Rende: the Brian Funk: watching! Kat Raio Rende: laundry room and just like write, you know, write things down or sing into the voice recorder. But. There's nothing like, I think of it as like neurodivergent writing, but it's just you get to write what you actually want to write, whereas everything else has to be in this like serious box and Brian Funk: Hmm. Kat Raio Rende: kids music you just do, like kids think like that and they enjoy it, so I really love it the most. Brian Funk: It's something I've taken to my artist side too. You know, playing in a band when we're trying to come up with music, a lot of times it does start out kind of silly and it's gibberish or blabbering or just placeholder lyrics. But being free enough to do that has opened the door to actually get into some of those other areas too. And I find Kat Raio Rende: Oh yeah. Brian Funk: it's something I encourage people to do is like. Don't be afraid to be silly. Don't be afraid to make bad music. And I try to remember that with myself because a lot of times things that might not seem like my masterpiece after I work on it for a little while starts to come together a little bit Kat Raio Rende: Mm-hmm. Brian Funk: when I'm not so judgmental about it. Kat Raio Rende: Oh, it'd be so nice to add that into it. Like Primus and Macklemore and Eminem and who else? There's some artists that really do it well. Brian Funk: Yeah. JP Rende: Harry Grip. Kat Raio Rende: Well, Perry Grip is a kid's artist, but JP Rende: Yeah, but Kat Raio Rende: he's JP Rende: he's Kat Raio Rende: like JP Rende: amazing. Kat Raio Rende: the king. Brian Funk: Yeah, and you mentioned too, I guess, the concept of just capturing ideas whenever you get them at the moment. So you're jumping out of bed. I think that's such a smart thing to do because I think they disappear so fast. Kat Raio Rende: I JP Rende: Yeah, Kat Raio Rende: mean, JP Rende: have Kat Raio Rende: sometimes, JP Rende: you, have you, oh sorry Kit. Kat Raio Rende: I was just gonna say sometimes, the whole song is there. Sometimes we'll read a brief when we get a song, and we will read a brief at night, or in the afternoon on a Sunday, and then wake up on a Sunday morning at two o'clock and be like, here, here's this, and there's the whole song. Or the main idea of the song usually comes in the middle of the night. And it's JP Rende: Yeah. Kat Raio Rende: so much fun because it's like you didn't write, I didn't, you know, like your subconscious writes it and you're like, that's a good idea, subconscious. Thank you. Brian Funk: Thanks for watching! JP Rende: Well, mine is sometimes I write the most amazing songs in my dreams and then like I wake up and they're fucking horrible. But in your dreams, like they're the greatest song ever. You're like, oh my God, I'm gonna Brian Funk: Yeah. JP Rende: change the world with this song and then you have all these accolades and people are singing your song and then you wake up and you hum a tune, you're like, what is that? So, but fortunately, cats middle of the night stuff is always. Brian Funk: Well, I think Kat Raio Rende: Most Brian Funk: it's Kat Raio Rende: of Brian Funk: important Kat Raio Rende: the time. Brian Funk: that you're comfortable with letting that stuff in. Even if it is, it turns out to be bad. Just let the music in or let it out, however you want to look at it. And Kat Raio Rende: You know what, Brian Funk: then Kat Raio Rende: writing, Brian Funk: later, judge. Kat Raio Rende: yeah, writing lyrics too. The way that I personally write lyrics is I'll write, and it goes for ideas in general. Even if you have really bad ideas, you kind of have to like. Expel them first so I'll write all the worst stuff and knowing it's not going to be possible knowing that like if you're writing for a specific character who's an octopus and you really need to change it, you know, it's and it's an octopus specific Line and it's definitely not going to work for them. You write it out anyway, and then Once you get all the bad, you know, once you get all the stuff that doesn't work out first, you know you have it like for some reason it just sticks in your brain until you let it, until you're like, okay, I'll give you some attention, you know, write it down, and now after that's done, the other stuff comes to mind for whatever reason. You know, you put your bad rhyme down, you put your... It's not like you have it as a placeholder either. You just literally have to like write it on a piece of paper, write it on a, you know, a Word document. And then... once you've given it the attention that it needed, it goes away and leaves room for other things, I think. Brian Funk: Last weekend we had a party at my house and it's like this thing we do once... JP Rende: Thanks for the invite, Brian. Kat Raio Rende: Hahaha! Brian Funk: Yeah, I'm JP Rende: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha Brian Funk: kind of sad because you guys aren't that far away. Kat Raio Rende: hehe Brian Funk: But we have just music outside, so we just set up drums and guitars Kat Raio Rende: Yeah. Brian Funk: and stuff. And there's a lot of jamming that happens. And it's very spontaneous, but... Sometimes you want to try to develop it a little bit and you sing a little bit and you just sort of have to be okay with whatever fits whatever works and just get stuff out and Sometimes the thing that might even have felt silly or dumb in the beginning starts to actually make sense and work That and I think that freedom That you give yourself to be okay with that Is so important because then if then the good stuff can come out without getting kind of gate-kept, you know, before it had a chance. JP Rende: For sure. I think that you really hit the nail on the head is you can't be afraid to write shit. You can't, you know? And what that can do is you gotta get that bad stuff out of you before the good stuff can come. And self-judgment is...we all suffer from it many times. And I commend you for doing that at a party, because I know that like... even in our studios, Cat's studio's not far from mine, but when we're each kind of like messing around with stuff, we really don't want the other person hearing it, just because Kat Raio Rende: Yeah. JP Rende: it's not that they're gonna judge it. I think Cat knows the way that I write and I know the way she writes, but it's just the fact that I wanna be able to get out all the kinks that I'm feeling, and I feel as though that... there's a bit of a show-off-ness when somebody else is hearing it. Brian Funk: Right. JP Rende: We're professionals, right? So we have to conduct ourselves as quote unquote professionals, so it's like we play the wrong chord in front of somebody else and they're like, you know a six is a minor, right? But Kat Raio Rende: Ha ha JP Rende: you Kat Raio Rende: ha! JP Rende: mess up and you play a major and you're like, oh no, I didn't do that. But when you're by yourself and you don't judge, then fun stuff can happen. So. Brian Funk: Hmm. JP Rende: I do think it's important to not be afraid to just mess around and make it sound like crap because for all you know the next time that you go sit down and write, one little nugget of that crap session could make the song that you're working on now. Brilliant. Kat Raio Rende: Wanna hear something, JB? That I've never JP Rende: Short. Kat Raio Rende: told you? I mean, it's not whatever. But the reason why I don't like to hear, for you to hear what I'm doing is because I think you're gonna like it. And I'm like, I'm not, it's not done, it's not done. So I think that like, you know, my first thing tends to be pretty, depending JP Rende: Oh, here it Kat Raio Rende: on JP Rende: comes. Kat Raio Rende: where it's coming from. JP Rende: Here it comes. I Kat Raio Rende: What? Brian Funk: Thank you. Kat Raio Rende: What do you think I was gonna say? JP Rende: thought you were gonna say like, my first thing tends to be really, really good, but it's not good enough for me. So I don't... Ha ha Kat Raio Rende: No, JP Rende: ha. Kat Raio Rende: no, it just like, it's just like a rough thing. And sometimes it's like a little bit simple or something. Sometimes like, my memory is kind of, I can't always access it. And sometimes I'll write something that I'm like, oh, this might be close to something I've worked on before, or sometimes like something I've written before. And, or it's like, you know, it's like, for lack of a better term, it's like derivative of my own stuff, I guess? And so I'll be like, I can't do, I want to do something new on this. Like I want to change, like there was, there's, there was a song we were working on yesterday for Baby Shark's Big Show and it was like this wacky, like really out there, like chord change that didn't belong because two characters who don't get along were trying to, were finding out that they were friends. And um, it, I, It was really out there and I'm like, this part is good. I don't want him to hear that because it's not actually finished. But the other chords were like so much the same and the same and the same. So I knew the rhythm was good. I knew the production was good. It was really good. I knew that you were going to like it, Jay. But I knew there was more to go and I knew it was going to be like, keep it. And that's what happened. JP Rende: Yeah. Kat Raio Rende: And I was like, oh, but you know, we did end up keeping it. And usually when he says stuff like that, it is the right, it was the right thing to do. So that's something that like, we tend to kind of hear, when we hear it undone, the other person will, either JP will pair it down for me or I will do something on his tracks. Brian Funk: Right, nice. You know, it's interesting, you guys, your situation, right? Cause you are partners in the music and you're married too. JP Rende: Mm-hmm. Brian Funk: And it's often, those are often comparisons that are made when you're in a band. It's like being married to a couple of people or all these relationships. And so much happens, I mean, within a relationship, but then within a musical relationship, and sometimes they affect the other relationship, you know? JP Rende: Absolutely. Brian Funk: but it seems like you guys have figured out some ways to make that work. And one of the maybe interesting things that's going on right now for people that are watching, they might be able to tell, but you guys are in the same building, right? Same house, Kat Raio Rende: Oh yeah. Brian Funk: but JP Rende: Mm-hmm. Brian Funk: different spaces. You have your own separate space for that, JP Rende: 100%. Kat Raio Rende: Yeah. Brian Funk: for your work. JP Rende: We learned this a long time ago. We do our best work together, but when we're actually like in a co-writing session, we both tend to be a little bit headstrong on our ideas and sometimes that affects the music in a negative way. So we found that part of our process that really works is that if we get a brief for, you know, we get hired to do something is that we'll come together for a very short while and say, okay, what are we thinking here? Okay, I'm thinking X, Y, and Z, and I'm thinking, okay, that's cool. And we do the collaboration there before we even get to an instrument, anything. And then it's like, okay, once we kind of settle on, let's say, okay, we're gonna do an up tempo that kind of has like something that sounds like this, the kind of pantomime or sing something with a drum beat that's like, th Kat Raio Rende: Mm-hmm. JP Rende: I'll add stuff, she'll sing some ideas, I'll sing some ideas, and then before we know it, we have a cohesive track and song, but then Kat is the last person, not the last person to touch it, because I do the mixing, but the last creative, so once she's singing it, she could be like, hmm, you know what, this idea really wasn't good, and just be like, hey. Do you mind if I try this? And sometimes I'm like, yeah. And sometimes I'm like, no. No, Kat Raio Rende: Hehehehehehe JP Rende: you may not. You may do it exactly the way I did it because I like it. And then we fight, and then we fight some more, then we argue, then we realize that I'm wrong and she realizes that she's wrong. We find somewhere, sometimes it's in the middle and then sometimes it's like, you know what, Kat? You're absolutely right. And that's it. So that's our process. It's not the most... Kat Raio Rende: collaborative? No, it is JP Rende: No, Kat Raio Rende: collaborative. JP Rende: no, it's not the most cohesive, but I think that it helps us and it helps save our personal life as well, because in the very beginning, we would argue in the studio, before we were married, before we were even dating, Kat Raio Rende: Yeah. JP Rende: and then it'd be like, well, I don't wanna see you for a while, I'm mad Brian Funk: Mm-hmm. JP Rende: at you, whatever. So we found that within our professional life to kind of keep it there. And then, you know, once we go upstairs and we're with our kids, it's like, you know, we'll still talk about it and we'll still sing, but the kind of negotiations are over at that Kat Raio Rende: Yeah, JP Rende: point. Kat Raio Rende: and it allows us to like show instead of tell. Like instead of being like, I want it to sound like X, Y, Z, and then they have their own idea of what it could be because it could be anything. Like we're trust. People trust us now, thank God. It allows us to show each other instead of having to tell them about it, which we'll never say. If you're like, I wanna marry these two styles that are crazy, the other person will be like, that's terrible. But if we have the right idea, it will end up working out. And also, on a side note, we're very serious, at least I am very serious about like, when work ends, we try not to talk about work. because if you're spending nearly all your time with someone, because don't forget, we go out with our friends and we go on dates and a lot of our time is spent together. We were like, okay, nine o'clock, I'm gonna go. and I'm gonna be on my room, you're gonna be on your room, and we can, you know, you have to knock before entering the whole thing. It has to be very separate so that the two of us can feel like we're not, like we're coming home from work or going Brian Funk: Mm-hmm. Kat Raio Rende: to work because it's, you know, just a staircase down instead of having to even leave the house, which is a wild Brian Funk: Right. Kat Raio Rende: thing. Brian Funk: Yeah. And it's hard enough on your own even to divide that kind of labor, especially when you're not clocking in Kat Raio Rende: Yeah. Brian Funk: every JP Rende: Mmm. Brian Funk: day, or you have the kind of job where it follows you, where you can take the work home or, you know, you can think about your music all day long, all night long Kat Raio Rende: Yeah. Brian Funk: to have those lines are really important. JP Rende: Well, what I find that's pretty awesome about our job is that we have deadlines. And deadlines, I think, are really, really important. Before we did this, you know, Cat was doing the artist thing, and I was doing the songwriter producer thing, and just writing songs and hoping people would buy them or pick them up and sing them or whatever, but there was no deadline. Like, I could take months on a song if I wanted to. And I feel as though that having deadlines helps us get fully involved in the project and then finishing it and on to the next one. And I find that helps creativity, creatively, for me at least, kind of be all in it and then boom, it's like a conveyor belt. It's off and the next one comes. So good, bad, or ugly, that project is at least until we either get feedback or whatever, is off the plate and we can kind of start fresh. So it's kind of like, I guess, is it Tiger Woods? I don't know, somebody's saying like, you can't, don't worry about the last shot you did, worry about the one you're doing now. Kat Raio Rende: Mm. JP Rende: And that's how I take the music. Kat Raio Rende: Especially pitching, because there's so much pitching involved. Even, JP Rende: Oh yeah. Kat Raio Rende: you know, we know all our peers who are at the top of their game still have to pitch. JP Rende: Yeah, I hate pitching. Kat Raio Rende: It's a wild thing. JP Rende: It's the worst. Kat Raio Rende: Like after you write it, it's none of your business. And you have to just like, that one's done. JP Rende: Mm-hmm. Kat Raio Rende: No matter what it does. Brian Funk: Can you take us through the process of a project, a song? You know, you mentioned a pitch, a brief, then the deadline, of course. JP Rende: Sure. Brian Funk: What does that look like and what is the general timeframe? Or maybe it depends on the project. JP Rende: It really depends on the project, really. Like we also work on jingles, and sometimes that's 24 hours. So something will come in, and like the Charmin, for instance, hey, and you know, we're gonna do these toilet songs. And a Brian Funk: Thanks JP Rende: lot Brian Funk: for watching! JP Rende: of times when it comes to jingles, the lyrics are already written, so we just kind of gotta make something out of it. But let me give you a, like in the... television world is a brief will come in. Well, do you want a pitch? They're very similar. Do you want a pitch or let's say we have the job and we're just working on the brief? Brian Funk: Can you do both? Cause JP Rende: Sure. Brian Funk: that JP Rende: They're Brian Funk: sounds JP Rende: very, Brian Funk: pretty JP Rende: very similar, Brian Funk: interesting. JP Rende: whereas, Brian Funk: Yeah. JP Rende: well, I'll do a pitch first. So we'll get an email from a network that, let's say Disney, we were just, got one last week. And it'll say, okay, here's the premise of the show, we're looking for a theme song, it's gotta be within 30 seconds to a minute long, it has to incorporate the kind of premise, sometimes they'll say we want the name of the show within the song, sometimes they will say we don't want the name of the show in the song, then they will give us references. And this is where, Kat Raio Rende: Hmm JP Rende: you know, I really dislike pitching is because the references are so bizarre sometimes and they don't make any sense. And I understand where they're coming from because I think that, you know, in a perfect world, it would be like, oh my God, we're gonna have like, you know, a Dua Lipa beat with a ska, you know, horn section, and then what we're gonna do is like, you know that like, really cool filtered guitar that Third Eye Blind used on their second record? We wanna have that in there with like, lyrics like Lizzo. Now, it sounds awesome, but it's nearly impossible to do. Brian Funk: Right. JP Rende: And sometimes people... people hit it, you know, but. Kat Raio Rende: I am gonna interrupt and just say that like, and sometimes the references, as they are for anyone are subjective. So like what Brian Funk: Hmm. Kat Raio Rende: I, as the show runner, might like about a specific song, might be different than what you might like. And so they'll be like, we really like this song. And sometimes they'll describe why they like it in an effort to really pinpoint it down. But sometimes you have to like, you know, especially if it's a very popular song, sometimes you have to be like, oh, that just means they want high energy. Brian Funk: Hmm. Kat Raio Rende: or like, you know, shake it off has been JP Rende: Oh, Cat, Kat Raio Rende: the JP Rende: I Kat Raio Rende: thing, JP Rende: was just about Kat Raio Rende: right? JP Rende: to play a game Kat Raio Rende: Or like, JP Rende: with you. I was like, Kat Raio Rende: Iconopop, JP Rende: all right, the Kat Raio Rende: shake JP Rende: first Kat Raio Rende: it off, JP Rende: song Kat Raio Rende: happy. JP Rende: that everybody always asks, I was gonna go one, two, three, and we were both gonna say Kat Raio Rende: Shake JP Rende: Shake Kat Raio Rende: it off. JP Rende: It Off. They love Shake It Off. They love that boom. Boom. Brian Funk: Right. JP Rende: Love Kat Raio Rende: Or JP Rende: it. Kat Raio Rende: like, and other times, the references are so, not obscure per se, but like so indie or so dark, which generally like doesn't work for kids stuff. And then the end product is never as indie or dark. It's just that like sometimes, and this is no disrespect to the showrunner, they don't want it to be dark or indie. They want it to have the show to have substance. I mean the song to have substance of some sort and so maybe you know that's how you're interpreting the fact that they have this like, you know, very slow song with very things that are very like off Inappropriate for a kid's song sometimes like and we only know this because we do it so much that that's not necessarily what they want They want a little bit of like a deeper vibe. That's JP Rende: Yeah, Kat Raio Rende: that's usually about it JP Rende: I think interpreting briefs is an art form in itself. Brian Funk: Hmm. JP Rende: Because again, it's not, you know, the showrunners and the network, they're not trying to make our life difficult. They're trying to get the best piece of music that, you know, conveys their idea of the show. And it's our job to kind of say, yeah, I get what you're saying, but I don't think that's exactly what you mean. Like Kat's saying. And sometimes it is, and a lot of times, you gotta just take a shot, and you gotta say, well, I don't know if they're really feeling it. I don't know if what they're asking for works. And again, sometimes we're right, and we'll win, and be like, okay, we had an instinct on what I think works for the show, and sometimes we're clearly wrong, and that's okay. I mean, that's all part of it, and I think that's where. the creativity lies within this kind of work is that we do have the freedom to choose or not to choose, Kat Raio Rende: Mm. Brian Funk: Mm-hmm. JP Rende: where otherwise we're just, you know. Kat Raio Rende: gonna be killed by AI. JP Rende: We're just cranking product down a conveyor belt, like just building cars, we're not. So we're able to kind of put our spin in what we do within those briefs. And again, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't, and that's just part of it. Brian Funk: So yeah, a lot of decoding. That happens in bands too. That happens Kat Raio Rende: Definitely. Brian Funk: especially when you're talking with people that aren't musicians. They'll say very abstract things. JP Rende: Well, Kat Raio Rende: Oh. JP Rende: that's one of the most difficult things is when we're getting feedback from non-musical people and they will always say, listen, I don't know music at all. And so anytime they'd be like, I'm like, okay, here it comes. And then it's just like, yeah, you're right. You don't know music at all. And Kat Raio Rende: Oh JP Rende: that, you know, but, you know, it's always really great when you're working with. a network that has a point music person because they're able to filter all the awesome ideas that's coming from the non-musical people and say, okay, I get it. I get what you want and I'm going to speak to the composers the way that I can convey that. So that's awesome. Kat Raio Rende: Yeah, it's very different working from a new show in a big network than a, you know, even a big show that's going to network or that is being developed. We really like working with new shows too. Brian Funk: Right, because you can craft that identity a Kat Raio Rende: Oh Brian Funk: bit, Kat Raio Rende: yeah. Brian Funk: I guess. Kat Raio Rende: Yeah, there's JP Rende: Mm-hmm. Brian Funk: Rather Kat Raio Rende: a little Brian Funk: than Kat Raio Rende: bit Brian Funk: trying Kat Raio Rende: more Brian Funk: to Kat Raio Rende: interpreting, Brian Funk: fit into it. Kat Raio Rende: but Brian Funk: Yeah. Kat Raio Rende: it's worth it. Brian Funk: Right. JP Rende: Definitely. Brian Funk: So that's a pitch. And JP Rende: Yeah. Brian Funk: that would mean basically you don't have the job yet. JP Rende: Oh no, Brian Funk: So they're kind of fishing around. JP Rende: that's the worst part about it. Again, I don't wanna be negative, but it's really, it's hard because you're putting all your effort into it. And again, actors have the same thing when they go on Kat Raio Rende: Yeah. JP Rende: the audition. Brian Funk: Yeah. JP Rende: This is part of the job and nobody likes it, but you can get... a real kind of sense of pride when you're able to crack that code and be like, look, Kat Raio Rende: Hehehe JP Rende: we gave you this and you love it and it works and it works on, you know, for the whole tone of the music of the series. So we really love that. Kat Raio Rende: Yeah, and a lot of times, sorry, a lot of times, if you've already had something that you really like that you could maybe reuse from something else, then you also have an opportunity to kind of like, I don't know how it is for you, but generally, we do this for a living and we really enjoy what we do as a job, but sometimes we have these other musical ideas that are. that we wouldn't maybe play with on our own, you know, if we have something or like if we just have the time to do a pitch, sometimes we'll do something really crazy and really out there just because like it's just another way to like flesh out what some idea that you that you have and a lot of times that works that does work because sometimes if you're getting five songs or more you're just going to pick something that jumps out to you. JP Rende: Yeah. Kat Raio Rende: And so a lot of times that's what works. JP Rende: Yeah, and now the... Kat Raio Rende: Assignzons? JP Rende: Assigned songs, thank you very much. Very, very similar except the pressure is kind of off because you know you have the job, but you know that there's always gonna be notes, there's always gonna be feedback. And sometimes it's great, actually I found that a lot of times the notes that come back are like, spot on, we're like, yes, I get that. Yes, our chorus takes too long to come in or this lyric just isn't really fitting, beautiful. But I do like the fact that we know we're gonna get a second shot. And a lot of times in pitching you don't get a second shot. It's like, yes, no. You've Brian Funk: Mm-hmm. JP Rende: done all the work, put all your heart and soul into this song, and then it's just like, sometimes it works for them, sometimes it doesn't. It really has nothing to do with your ability. It has nothing to do with that your music isn't good. It just wasn't working for, or what they, it just wasn't what... they had in mind and that's fine. But when you're assigned a song, if you do deliver something that isn't exactly what they have in mind, you get other chances to kind of revise it and kind of, I guess it becomes another collaborative process then with the network. And I think that's always, I love collaborating. So I find that it's kind of fun to collaborate with people that don't necessarily do exactly what you do. Kat Raio Rende: Mm. JP Rende: especially with script writers, collaborating with them is so much fun. Like Kat said, showrunners, which most of the time are also script writers. So yeah, it's a lot of fun. Brian Funk: How much time do you generally have to Kat Raio Rende: Hehehe Brian Funk: work on a song? JP Rende: Um, okay. So pitches and assigned songs are roughly about a week. You get about a week Kat Raio Rende: depending JP Rende: to Kat Raio Rende: on JP Rende: do Kat Raio Rende: what JP Rende: it. Kat Raio Rende: kind JP Rende: Depend, Kat Raio Rende: of a song JP Rende: depending Kat Raio Rende: it is JP Rende: on sometimes, Kat Raio Rende: and how JP Rende: you Kat Raio Rende: big JP Rende: know, Kat Raio Rende: it JP Rende: we've, Kat Raio Rende: is. JP Rende: we've been known to be the, the team that gets called on the ninth hour where Kat Raio Rende: Thanks for watching. JP Rende: they've gone through so many different like rounds and they're like, okay, JP and Kat, sadly, you have two days. Can you Kat Raio Rende: Yeah. JP Rende: do it? And we're always like, yes, yes. And, and that kind of like. puts a little pep in our step, because we're like, all right, let's get down to business. But generally, for television, it's usually about a week, sometimes two. That's with songs. Now with underscore, because we also do a lot of that, how that goes is we will get a animatic. which is basically like a storyboard and it'll be a couple scenes. Sometimes it's a whole episode and that's nuts, but most likely it's a few scenes, so there'll be like a real action scene, a kind of sentimental scene, maybe a comedic scene, and they're not gonna spot you. You're just gonna go for what you think is best for that. Now that's a... also a very, very tough ask because usually when we're spotting, when we're working on a show, the director is spotting us. So what that means is music spotting for those who don't know, we will watch the show or movie together and they'll say, okay, at time code. whatever, I need something, I need a hit here. So he's gonna open a door and slam it, so within the music I need to hear that. And then what I want you to do right after that, there's gonna be something lurking around the corner in a few seconds, so I want you to start giving me something that's a little bit foreboding, you know. And that's Kat Raio Rende: Thanks for watching. JP Rende: beautiful because they're telling you what they want. But then where the art comes in is like foreboding can mean a lot of different things. And depending on the project that you're working on, especially if you're doing animation, it can't sound like, you know, the inception soundtrack. Kat Raio Rende: Hehehehe JP Rende: It can't be the most like wildly dark thing. I don't care if there's a monster coming out. The Brian Funk: Alright. JP Rende: monster is gonna look like a silly little nothing. You can't have like real, or sometimes you can, but in my experience, they'll say things like foreboding or peril, but you gotta kind of read the room, as they say, like it's for children, Brian Funk: Right? JP Rende: a lot of times. Kat Raio Rende: That's interesting about the underscoring is like you're giving, you're kind of giving children the, when it comes to doing for children, you're giving them the emotion that's not being said, especially if it's one that's a little bit like higher level than they know. Like a lot of times we'll write, we'll write, there have been episodes of like Tab Time on YouTube where she gets into serious, Tab Time has Tab at the Brown. and she gets into serious concepts like death and separation JP Rende: Yeah. Kat Raio Rende: and when, and Sesame Street too, and when you write underscore or music for them, you're empathizing with the feelings that they can't put into words yet just developmentally. And it's nice because if you can't say it because it's just something that they just don't get it. you're still giving them something musically that they can feel. And that really helps, I think. JP Rende: Definitely. Brian Funk: Right, guiding them through the feelings. JP Rende: Yeah, and it's really nice to, as our company grows earworm, to be able to wear the different hats. I mean, we love writing songs. Like we started as song people and I think we'll always be song people first. But as the years progressed and we started doing more underscoring and sound design and it's just, that's a fun, fun job Brian Funk: Hmm. JP Rende: because Kat Raio Rende: Mm. JP Rende: you, like, You are building the tone of the whole show. Kat Raio Rende: Yeah. JP Rende: And like one of our really good friends and collaborators, P.T. Walkley, who is the main music guy for Gabby's Dollhouse and also Blue's Clues and You, his sound is just so amazing. And you can always tell when it's a P.T. cue or song and he created that sound for that show. And whenever we're lucky enough to be involved, what we're doing is bringing our sensibilities, but knowing that it's PT's world. So we have to be in that world. So that's a big responsibility on both parties, whether you're additional composer, which is what we are for Gabby's, or main composer, because it's, again, it's your world that you're creating. And... That's the most fun part when you're working on a show from the ground up, is that you're really helping shape the sound of the show. Kat Raio Rende: Mm. Brian Funk: Right, right. Yeah, very delicate thing. There's a video on YouTube I show my sampling class. Mrs. Doubtfire recast as a horror film, JP Rende: Oh Brian Funk: recut JP Rende: my Brian Funk: as JP Rende: god, Brian Funk: a horror film JP Rende: I Brian Funk: as JP Rende: love Brian Funk: a trailer. JP Rende: it. Kat Raio Rende: Oh yeah! JP Rende: I love it. Brian Funk: It's JP Rende: I Brian Funk: hysterical JP Rende: love that. Brian Funk: because Mrs. Doubtfire, fun loving family film, you change the music a little bit and it gets stalker, creepy vibes, you know, and it real JP Rende: 100%. Brian Funk: fast becomes... Kat Raio Rende: That's JP Rende: 100%, Kat Raio Rende: like a perfect JP Rende: and I love that. Kat Raio Rende: example. JP Rende: I love that because, you know, now that we're in a new time, I don't know if Mrs. Doubtfire would play well in this. It is a bit creepy, you Kat Raio Rende: Totally JP Rende: know, Kat Raio Rende: creepy. JP Rende: like a dad dressing up like an old woman just to see his kids because his wife doesn't want him. Like, it could be a horror movie. Brian Funk: Yeah, it's delicate. JP Rende: Actually, I think it would be a fucking amazing horror movie. Kat Raio Rende: Hehehehe JP Rende: Heh heh heh. Brian Funk: Yeah, it doesn't take much to change that. So it's a great example of how important the vibe and tone is. Kat Raio Rende: Definitely. Brian Funk: And JP Rende: Definitely. Brian Funk: I can only imagine, especially working with films and TV shows for kids, that's so important. JP Rende: Mm-hmm. Yeah, I would say, you know... B. The, I guess, kids and family kind of space that we find ourselves in most of the time, not all the time, but most of the time, it kind of has a really wide spectrum of stuff, and I love it. I really do love it, because we can be as silly sometimes and as serious, just like Cat was saying with Tab Time. We did just do an episode on death. where there is a song that we didn't write, but we had to produce and then do the underscore. And it's a real heartfelt song about missing somebody and it's important. So it's like, just because it lands in the kids and family space, doesn't mean that there isn't a depth there as well. So I think it's a great space to be in. Kat Raio Rende: Yeah, I think the depth comes from honoring what you're talking about. And that goes with like, not only the concepts, but like. like if we're doing like a celebrity song, also honoring their own their own styles. Like I think people would I think when you have a celebrity on a show and you're writing something that's not really that their style of song, it's it just doesn't come off even to the kids as authentic because they're like I listen to you know Cardi B or I listen to the Jones Brothers and that's not their style. So like. like when we did a song for Cardi B on Baby Shark's big show called Seaweed Sway, like it was a big task to write for her, first of all, on the show at all, like her being who she is, and like her being like on a bash, like I'm gonna say what I want, I'm gonna do what I want, and having like the hair history of like WAP and all that, it's like that stuff, to put her in this space could be just like a big. a big flop because if you wrote something that was childish for her or in the wrong genre but we had to make sure and same thing with Billy Porter. We had to make sure that the production that we did that was not by her producers or Billy Porter's producers, the production that we did for her or him was their style of production and even embodying and trying to empathize with their own writing style or their own... Lyric style or their own melodies is a big deal like you have to be authentic for kids in every single way like even there was a we did like a we did like a Hanukkah song once and a lot of the song like we my stepfather's Jewish and We've celebrated Hanukkah number of times, especially when our kids were born But like a lot of times the Hanukkah songs are like, we are celebrating Hanukkah and we're gonna put a mammonora. And like everything is so like, like you're talking at kids instead of coming from like a place of empathy. And so we wrote this really fun song. What was the name of the song? JP Rende: uh... a fish devil of lights Kat Raio Rende: Okay, JP Rende: because Kat Raio Rende: the JP Rende: of Kat Raio Rende: title, JP Rende: the Brian Funk: Hehehe Kat Raio Rende: the title notwithstanding, the song had to be like a JP Rende: I Kat Raio Rende: hey. JP Rende: don't think we wrote, I actually think that when we were assigned that song, they wanted it to be called that. I don't think we came up with that Kat Raio Rende: Oh yeah, JP Rende: title. Kat Raio Rende: we did not. JP Rende: No. I don't Kat Raio Rende: We JP Rende: think Kat Raio Rende: did not. JP Rende: we wrote that song. Kat Raio Rende: But, um, but, um, the song was from like a, hey, we've all been celebrating this and you can learn from us, but we're gonna tell you what it's, you know, we're not gonna tell you as a person who doesn't know anything about it, because if you celebrate Hanukkah, like, you know all that stuff. And Brian Funk: Mm-hmm. Kat Raio Rende: you learn, a lot of times I think that at least our kids like learn more not by talking at them, but talking about it in conversation, like, oh, this is what we're doing. And they pick up better when they feel like you're talking about something in a connected way versus like talking at them. JP Rende: Yeah, and actually, just to jump in, do you remember how when we first started Friends with a Penguin? This is a cool story. So we did our normal, like, hey, Billy Porter, cool. And with Sesame Street, we don't write the lyrics, we just write the music. So we got these lyrics, and again, on face value, it's like, what the hell is this? You know, but then you start to read into them and then you read the scripts and you're like, oh, okay, I get it. And I remember I was like, I got this, Cat. So I went into the studio and I started writing something and it was good, but it was not Billy Porter's, like it was not his sound at all. And I was like, yeah, but he could sing this and it would sound good doing it. Cat's like, yeah, that's true, but like Billy Porter is like larger than life. Kat Raio Rende: Yeah. JP Rende: So then she was like, all right, now I got this. So then I was like, okay, you're the boss. She took it and started adding the strings and the real fun things, and then that kind of inspired me. And we kind of went, it was a real cool collaborative effort, but if Cat didn't stop me from, I think it sounded, I think it started to sound like an Andy Grammer song, which is fine, like, and. Definitely Billy Porter's such a wonderful singer. He could do it, but is that Billy Porter? Absolutely not. And then when the video and he was wearing that awesome gown, it was just so cool. And that was Kat telling me to like, whoa, steady boy. You got it. You. Brian Funk: I think it's awesome that you guys do that. It must be such a fun creative challenge as well. Kat Raio Rende: It's definitely better than other jobs we could have had. Huh. Brian Funk: Right. JP Rende: Yeah, I always joke that like when, you know, I might have, you know, I would have to learn how to make a really cool cup of coffee at Starbucks, you know, if anything happened with this, because, you know, we just love it so much and we've just devoted so much of our time and energy into it and don't want to do anything else. Brian Funk: It's fantastic. You guys have had so much success with it. Great. Follow your dreams story, you know? And JP Rende: Definitely, Brian Funk: it's JP Rende: definitely. Brian Funk: really... JP Rende: And again, we're always learning and we're always trying to get better. By no means do I think that we are finished products. I think that we are work in progress. And, you know, like right now, it's a slow time for us with the rider strike and the sag strike and networks kind of cutting back. So... what we're doing is we're utilizing this time to kind of hone in our craft and always stay relevant. And just, it's a great time to kind of check where you're at and kind of project where you wanna be. And that's kind of part of the reason that like my Emmy I gave to my parents, cause I don't wanna look at that every day and just Kat Raio Rende: Hehehe JP Rende: be like, see, look what I accomplished, you know? It was a great accomplishment and I'm very proud of that, but I'm also looking to the future on the other wonderful projects that we will be involved in. Kat Raio Rende: And we are involved with. We have a number of projects. I don't know, can we talk about the, no, thank you. I was like, JP Rende: No, no, unfortunately we can't because, Kat Raio Rende: I just get to like, how do JP Rende: yeah. Kat Raio Rende: I do this? JP Rende: I mean, yeah, I'll tell, I can tell you, Brian, just don't put this in. We're gonna do the Baby Shark live show. We're gonna, we were hired to do the music for a live stage performance, but I don't know Brian Funk: Oh JP Rende: if Brian Funk: cool. JP Rende: it's been, I don't know if it's been announced or anything, so yeah. Kat Raio Rende: I was talking about the other JP Rende: What Kat Raio Rende: project. JP Rende: Barbie? Kat Raio Rende: No, 80. JP Rende: Oh, you know what? Actually, I wanna come back on your show, dude. Kat Raio Rende: haha JP Rende: I think this is Brian Funk: Yeah. JP Rende: awesome. We will talk about some of these other projects as well as they come out. This one is one that we're developing on our own. But no, it's not ready to be discussed yet. Brian Funk: Okay. Well, cool. We'll do a little wrap up then and then I'll trim this to fit nice. You guys have such a cool partnership both musically and as far as life goes. Earwormny.com is the website. Is there anywhere else you'd like to send people to check out your work? JP Rende: I believe my Insta is, my Instagram is also EarwormNY. Brian Funk: Mm-hmm. JP Rende: Is that correct, Kat? All Kat Raio Rende: Yep, AeroWorm JP Rende: right, Kat Raio Rende: NY. JP Rende: cool. EarwormNY. Brian Funk: Nice. JP Rende: I did have a TikTok for a minute Brian Funk: Thank you. JP Rende: and I was doing not music. I thought that I was gonna be the new Dave Portnoy of Serial, because Kat Raio Rende: I'm JP Rende: I love Serial. So Kat Raio Rende: sorry. JP Rende: I called myself the Serial Slayer. I think I stopped, I did a few things. So like, I would buy these like, junk cereals and I would be like, wow, cereal, and I would taste them and I would review them. But I haven't done that in a long time. And Kat Raio Rende: No, but you're very serious about cereal. JP Rende: I'm very serious about cereal. I love cereal. But I remember Kat, you know, this is part of our personal life. She's like, you know, maybe you should, you know, lay off on doing those reviews, you know? Kat Raio Rende: Okay, JP Rende: And I'm like. Kat Raio Rende: wait, no, my thing about it was not that part. It was the fact that we were opening a full box of cereal every, like every day, and it was always like junk cereal, but also like that we were wasting like the milk in the cereal because you can't eat that much cereal. JP Rende: Oh yeah, that was the whole stick. It was like, how Kat Raio Rende: Do you know JP Rende: fun Kat Raio Rende: how big his bowl was? JP Rende: would, it wouldn't be fun to just pour regular, so I would, I took a salad bowl, poured the entire box in, Kat Raio Rende: I'm gonna JP Rende: took Kat Raio Rende: go. JP Rende: all the milk, because Brian Funk: Right. JP Rende: it was the visual, like, you know, but Brian Funk: Yeah. JP Rende: yeah, turns out that having a successful YouTube channel or TikTok account or any sort of food review, it's very difficult. It's not as easy as it looks, as obviously you know with your show. Brian Funk: Well, maybe it's like a song title you can bank for later. Serious about cereal. JP Rende: Serious About Cereal, Brian Funk: All JP Rende: I Brian Funk: right, JP Rende: love Brian Funk: come JP Rende: that. Brian Funk: up. JP Rende: That's actually really good. That would Brian Funk: Yeah. JP Rende: be like a really fun, like just kids song. Cause like we write a lot of songs around the house with our kids all the time. Kat Raio Rende: Yeah. Brian Funk: Yeah. JP Rende: And I don't even want to call it writing because it's just stream of consciousness and it's just so much fun. And sometimes, actually we were going upstate this weekend, just Kat and I, and we were talking about that. I would really love to be part of a project where we could just come up with stream of consciousness songs and not have to worry about like production value or anything, it could just be like, just silly, silly stuff that just, you know, kind of makes you giggle. Like, I don't know who wrote, there was a show on Nickelodeon many years ago called Sanjay and Craig. I've never really Brian Funk: Yeah. JP Rende: watched the show, but I remember hearing the theme song and it was just like, Sanjay and Craig. They're in the best friends hall of fame. Sanjay, hey Craig. There is no best friends hall of fame. They lied, we made it up or something. Kat Raio Rende: I'm gonna go. JP Rende: And it was just the Brian Funk: Thanks for watching. JP Rende: most absurd thing. And again, the song itself is very catchy. I'm still singing it, but I don't remember it having to like, it wasn't like super slick production. It was just funny. So like Brian Funk: Right. JP Rende: out there, anybody wants really silly songs that just have. stream of consciousness, things, we are your people. Brian Funk: I love it. Kat Raio Rende: Sounds like a TikTok channel, Jade. Just saying. JP Rende: No, can't do it, can't do it. Brian Funk: Too much cereal in a bowl. JP Rende: too much cereal in a bowl. Brian Funk: You gotta make your choices. But hey, I know we're running late here, so we'll wrap it up. It was really awesome talking to you guys. JP Rendy and KatReyo Rendy. Check out EarwormNY.com. So much fun music on there. And congratulations on the Emmy. JP Rende: Thank you. Brian Funk: And I wish you all the best of luck, and hopefully we'll get to chat again soon. JP Rende: Definitely. Kat Raio Rende: Yeah. JP Rende: And next time, if you're ever playing live, we'd love to come and see you. Kat Raio Rende: Yeah. Brian Funk: Yeah, same. Yeah, we're not too far apart. So that'd Kat Raio Rende: Thanks. Brian Funk: be cool. Kat Raio Rende: Where are you? Brian Funk: Long Island. Kat Raio Rende: Wow, that's not Brian Funk: Yeah, Kat Raio Rende: far at all. Cool. Brian Funk: no, not at all. Cool. JP Rende: Awesome. Brian Funk: Thank you guys and thank you, JP Rende: Thanks man. Brian Funk: everyone, for listening. JP Rende: Be good. Kat Raio Rende: Thank you."

Al Church)\u201d by Gaelynn Lea from Deepest Darkness, Brightest Dawn That was from today\u2019s special holiday guest. She is on the latest Celtic Christmas Playlist.  HOLIDAY FEATURE: Gaelynn Lea Traditional fiddle music tugs at the heartstrings, and it infuses feeling into what is otherwise notes on a page. There\u2019s something transformative about it. Not only has Gaeylnn Lea mastered her craft, but her experimental use of this time-honored instrument adds yet another dimension to the sound. Melodies are stretched and harmonies are crafted by her use of live looping, paired with obvious classical training. It\u2019s updated, and ultimately, very satisfying. Cellist Zoe Keating springs to mind as one listens to Lea\u2019s use of her chosen instrument. It\u2019s no wonder she has drawn attention for her music\u2014she has really been carving out her own niche in the industry. Gaelynn has been playing the violin for over two decades, and there\u2019s little doubt she\u2019s comfortable with bow in hand. It really does take a person mastering an instrument before experimentation can be successful. The challenge is to depart from the norm and create something unique\u2014all while expanding on previous training. The skill is still in there--but the music grows larger and more full. This is what Gaelynn does, and it\u2019s a pleasure to hear the thread of the familiar woven in with the freshness of something new at the hands of an experienced artist. The musician has been recognized for her work\u2014being chosen as the winner of NPR Music\u2019s 2016 Tiny Desk Contest, recognized as a benchmark in the world of music. This competition brings in thousands of submissions, and to win is quite the accomplishment! Those who are looking for a forward-looking holiday collection of music will want to investigate Lea\u2019s album, \"Deepest Darkness, Brightest Dawn\". The tracks that are included here boast many of the well-known popular carol names, such as Angels We Have Heard on High, Silent Night, Away in a Manger, and O Come, O Come Emmanuel--but you haven\u2019t ever heard them played like this before. The 14-track album is an easy fit for anyone who is a true strings aficionado, and it would round out any collection of holiday music. Perfect for everything from a romantic candlelight dinner with your love, or at a family gathering, \u201cDeepest Darkness, Brightest Dawn\u201d is a delight to listen to. Experience the joy of hearing Christmas favorites that are coaxed into a new form through the hands of a talented musician.

They are on the latest Celtic Christmas Playlist-Christmas Driving Music. HOLIDAY FEATURE: Abbots Cross Pair up two experienced musicians who enjoy Celtic music and what do you get? Well, in this case, you get Abbots Cross! One half of this duo is Alan Booth, who plays guitar, fiddle, and provides the vocals for the group. Alan comes from a musical family and has been steeped in it all his life, starting with piano at the tender age of five, and having two music teachers for parents. He even does musical volunteer work in the Pittsburgh area where he\u2019s from\u2014and has traveled all the way to Kenya to share his deep love of singing and playing instruments.\u00a0 The second half of this duo is Mike Clancy, who provides the percussion, as well as the Irish flute and whistles to the mix. Also a seasoned musician, he has performed for several of the Broadway shows that have traveled to Pittsburgh. Mike plays with several bands in addition to Abbots Cross, and has even created original jazz compositions and released them to CD himself.\u00a0 It\u2019s easy to see how the blending of these two men would provide the foundation for a solid band, and they do come together well to highlight their considerable talents! The holiday album, \u201cChristmas Visions\u201d is a 10-track offering that has such interesting arrangements\u2014and they are deftly played. Clancy\u2019s flute takes center stage in many of these tracks, and it just adds so much to the music. In particular, God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen is just fantastic. These guys know how to stay true to the spirit of a holiday song while experimenting with what you can do with the music. Everything on this album has a very natural, free-flowing feel to it. It\u2019s as if the arrangements are loose and the two musicians just get in the groove and have a good time pushing their abilities. A veritable Christmas \u201cjam session\u201d! Don\u2019t miss Si Bheag, Si Mhor / The First Noel. It\u2019s hauntingly beautiful, beginning with the flute and then picking up the guitar gently in the background. This track builds slowly and easily with a warmth and genuineness that is very pleasing. Deck the Halls is happy and cheery as it should be, but also paired with a Christmas Eve Reel, adding that Celtic flavor and appeal.\u00a0 This holiday compilation by Abbots Cross is a real treat, and a standout among the many Christmas albums. Don\u2019t miss the chance to add something different to your collection of Celtic music that will help you get into the mood for celebrating!\u00a0 \u201cSi Bheag, Si Mhor/The First Noel\u201d by Abbots Cross from Christmas Visions \u00a0 IF YOU ENJOY THIS ARTIST...

HOLIDAY FEATURE: Matt & Shannon Heaton One of the lovely things about Celtic music is the fact that just a couple of people can make a whole lot of music, and this is certainly true when it comes to Matt & Shannon Heaton. This music duo offers flute/guitar/bouzouki and sweet, sweet harmony vocals in arrangements that are quite lovely.\u00a0 Deeply involved in the Boston traditional music scene, the pair plays together seamlessly, and the enthusiasm that they have for the music really comes through. There\u2019s a genuineness that is unmistakeable grounding their play. A husband and wife team can certainly telegraph their collective love for the music--and the sheer fun they have playing together. This one does it better than most.\u00a0 The two are definitely experienced, and surround themselves with music in many different ways. Shannon has her own podcast, Irish Music Stories, and she\u2019s also the co-founder of Boston\u2019s Celtic music fest, which undoubtedly expanded her vision and abilities in the field.\u00a0 Matt is front man for another band, the \"surf-rock\" Electric Heaters, and performs with a wide range of bands and musicians when he\u2019s not playing with Shannon. Each an accomplished musician in their own right, the blend of the two is a true celebration of musical talent\u2014dosed with a wholesome affection for the Celtic sound. It\u2019s a pleasure to hear them play. The couple\u2019s Christmas song collection is filled with a little bit of everything. You\u2019ll find fresh holiday fare as well as traditional favorites like \u201cO Little Town of Bethlehem\u201d and \u201cIt Came Upon the Midnight Clear\u201d to sing along to. Irish music lovers will appreciate the jigs and reels that are included in the mixture, and there\u2019s certainly enough here to fill a holiday party to the brim with some good cheer.\u00a0 Don\u2019t miss \u201cJulius the Christmas Cat\u201d\u2014it couldn\u2019t be any sweeter, and is sure to be a favorite for those who love their feline friends. Nothing like a cute little \"story song\" to get in the holiday spirit! Other notable tracks in this collection include \u201cChristmas in Mt. Horeb\u201d and \u201cWexford Carol,\u201d but there really isn\u2019t a bad track on the compilation.\u00a0 There\u2019s 13 tracks offered here, and listeners who love the flute will really be pleased, as it appears often on these tracks. Soft harmonies and easy strumming on the guitar are other hallmarks of what this holiday album is all about. There\u2019s little doubt this will have a place in any rotation of Christmas music where an updated Celtic sound is welcomed.\u00a0 You can find out more about them at https://mattandshannonheaton.com/\u00a0 IF YOU ENJOY THIS ARTIST...

I am a Celtic musician and I love Christmas music. In each episode, I introduce you to Celtic musicians from the Irish & Celtic Music Podcast who are creating great Christmas music. This year I have an all new format. Instead of sharing the music in podcast form, I\u2019ve created a  playlist over on Spotify called Celtic Christmas Women. I hope to add YouTube and Amazon Music. But right now, it\u2019s just on Spotify. If you prefer the podcast format and want more Celtic Christmas MUSIC episodes of the podcast, make sure you join our Celtic Christmas Fans on Patreon. You\u2019ll get a music-only episode and will join the other 51 patrons who are helping spread Christmas Cheer! That said, this is actually the final MUSIC episode of the Celtic Christmas podcast.

We now have over 300 kind souls who donate to the podcast each and every month. They collectively pledge over $800 per episode to make this show happen. I was already planning a Celtic Christmas Women episode. But because of that milestone, I decided to turn it into a 2-hour special. Plus, I\u2019m adding another 2-hour special next month. So in this show I\u2019m gonna share Christmas music by women playing Celtic music. That\u2019s because women don\u2019t get the attention they deserve in the music business in general and in Celtic music either. So I\u2019m gonna highlight these ladies.

I'll introduce you to SHARON SHANNON as we take an inside look at artists in the latest episode of the Celtic Christmas Podcast.\u00a0 \u00a0 \"Little Christmas\" is the final episode of 2020. It features Christmas music from The Jig Is Up, Cynthia Shelhart, Steel Clover, Abbots Cross, Liz Madden, Laura MacKenzie, Reilly, Sharon Shannon, deCeadaoin, Tiffany Schaefer, Emish, Stephanie Claussen, Celtic Woman, Runa, The Selkie Girls \u00a0 The show is generously brought to you by the Patrons of the Celtic Christmas Podcast on Patreon.

Interestingly, although she can and does play Irish music, her career has continually spanned many different musical genres, always bringing her own style and background along with her for the ride. She is an experienced and dedicated musician, and has worked with some huge names in the industry. Among the people/bands she has recorded and performed with, you\u2019ll find well-respected (and well-known!) Irish names like Sinead O\u2019Connor, The Chieftains, Shane McGowan, and even Bono. In keeping with her genre-jumping style though, you\u2019ll also see her name has appeared alongside other musical heavyweights, like Jackson Browne and Wille Nelson. As if that isn\u2019t testament enough to Shannon\u2019s musical abilities, she has also collaborated with John Prine, Natalie McMaster, and even Japan\u2019s Kodo Drummers! \u00a0 Good musicians are always eager to expand their circle and play with other talented people, and this is something that defines Sharon Shannon. It is also something that has allowed her to grow, and that has seasoned her as a musical artist. From classical, to Cajun, to rap, Shannon has embraced all forms of music and in turn, they have informed her approach and style along the way. Interestingly, the Irish influence always does seem to shine through though, no matter who she has paired herself with! \u00a0 Shannon has a well-rounded selection of albums, but with the holidays quickly approaching, nothing is more appropriate than than the Christmas single, \u201cChristmas Time Again\u201d, which features her accordion play front and center. It\u2019s a nice, jolly romp\u2014a bit more updated than the old, standard carols--but with the same spirit of fun. Pick this one up to add something different to your holiday playlist, or to gift to a friend or relative that loves expanding their collection of Christmas music. After all, there\u2019s always a little bit of room for the accordion\u2026right? \u00a0 Find out more about Sharon Shannon at sharonshannon.com \u00a0 If you hear music you love in the Celtic Christmas Podcast, then support the artists.

Not only does she have a cache of her own solo albums, but she is an actress and musical theater performer as well. In addition, she has done voiceover work and it\u2019s easy to see why\u2014her gentle, bright, clear voice is a pleasure to listen to, whether she is speaking or singing. Madden has delved deeply into studying the things she is interested in, and holds a Masters degree in music, and she is working toward one in theology as well. Her list of accomplishments really does go on and on, and they include everything from songwriting credits for film and television, to producing a live show, to winning multiple awards throughout the course of her career. \u00a0 Such a full and total immersion in the arts shows fierce passion and a dedication to creating, and this is apparent in Madden\u2019s musical history. She has contributed to 12 albums, and is actively involved in collaborating with other musical artists on a regular basis. Her albums tend to favor simple arrangements that allow her beautiful voice to be the centerpiece, with instruments serving as a support, rather than the central focus. It works well, and Madden\u2019s voice is definitely worthy of having a place that is front and center. She has certainly earned it, developing her voice as a well-honed instrument in its own right. Not all singers are blessed with such an even measure of talent and passion, but this is a singer that certainly has a heaping spoonful of both. \u00a0 Her holiday album, \"Liz Madden\u2019s Christmas Celebration\" offers nearly an hour of music that ranges from delights such as the French carol Noel Nouvelet to some of the more expected holiday favorites like Joy to the World, and We Wish You a Merry Christmas. The satisfying mixture of simple arrangements and a classically trained voice make this singer's holiday album a perfect choice for the season. A well thought-out grouping of 17 tracks provides a solid Christmas soundtrack that would make a terrific gift\u2014or would blend in well with nearly any rotation of holiday music you may already own. Whatever you do, be sure not to miss Madden\u2019s version of Silent Night\u2014it\u2019s a song that was meant to be covered by a vocalist with her range, and she does it beautifully, hitting those high notes with confidence and clarity. \u00a0 Find out more about Liz Madden at LizMadden.co. \u00a0 If you hear music you love in the Celtic Christmas Podcast, then support the artists.

I'll introduce you to THE ROGUES as we take an inside look at artists in the latest episode of the Celtic Christmas Podcast.\u00a0 \u00a0 \"The Snows That Melt the Soonest\" is the 4th episode of 2020 and show #58. It features Christmas music from Runa, Stephanie Claussen, David Pedrick, Matt & Shannon Heaton, Steel Clover, Mark O'Connor, Marc Gunn, deCeadaoin, Andrew D. Huber, The Rogues, Sheri O'Meara, Abbots Cross, Reilly, Prydein, The Jig Is Up!. \u00a0 The show is generously brought to you by the Patrons of the Celtic Christmas Podcast on Patreon.

This Celtic band didn\u2019t stay put in Houston for long though, and soon they were off--traveling all over the U.S., and even abroad. They\u2019ve performed in Canada, Scotland, and Greece, among other places over the years, as well as providing entertainment on a number of different cruise ships. This great mixture of experiences has allowed the band the opportunity to truly hone their live shows, and put a shine on their ability to play together in a variety of different contexts. It has also given them a great deal of expertise in terms of playing Celtic tunes. \u00a0 The Rogues are no amateurs when it comes to playing their instruments either, and band members have won prestigious music competitions, including first place in the World Pipe Band Championships in Grade III in 1998. If pressed to describe them, you could say they take their music seriously, but they don\u2019t take themselves too seriously, which results in a nice mash up of outstanding musicianship and good fun\u2014it really works out well. Plus, you know a band is not messing around when they wind up with their own tartan in the Scottish Register of Tartans. That\u2019s dedication to the Celtic genre at a deep level. \u00a0 You can\u2019t help but notice a full pipe sound and a lot of percussion when you listen to this band play, but they are also capable of music that pulls at the heartstrings. The variety of instruments, arrangements, and pairings keeps things interesting, no matter how familiar the tune. This is especially evident on The Rogues 2013 Christmas album, Hellbound Sleigh, where you\u2019ll hear tried-and-true favorites such as \u201cWe Wish You a Merry Christmas\u201d and \u201cGod Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen\u201d in a very different light. Be sure to listen to the \"O Holy Night / Ave Maria\u201d track, which has an almost haunting feel to it\u2014in the best possible way. And\u2014don\u2019t miss \"Jingle Bells/Good King Wenceslas\u201d for a rousing take on this classic that showcases the pipes front and center. \u00a0 The best part about this festive album though is the fact that there are also a few tracks you won\u2019t find in every Christmas collection, making it a great pick for your music rotation this holiday season. Keep it all to yourself and enjoy listening at home, or ship it over to a friend or family member that needs a little bit \u2018o cheer in the stocking. \u00a0 Find out more about The Rogues at therogues.com\u00a0 \u00a0 If you hear music you love, then support the artists.

I'll introduce you to SCREAMING ORPHANS as we take an inside look at artists in the latest episode of the Celtic Christmas Podcast.\u00a0 \u00a0 \"The Snows That Melt the Soonest\" is the 4th episode of 2020 and show #58.

As a matter-of-fact, their Mam used to be the band\u2019s singer, and their Da was their engineer and manager before they struck out on their own to tour. The combination of leaving their parents behind, the \u201cscreaming\u201d sounds that come with four girls living in an active household, and the fact that a school they attended actually was (previously) an orphanage all gelled together to create this catchy moniker for the group. It\u2019s one that is not easily forgotten! \u00a0 The girls started music young, eventually evolving into a pop rock band in their teens, and over time they just continued to blossom. The band began performing locally, and their circle quickly began to expand. Before long the ladies were chosen to play at a concert in Kildare, where known names such as Christy Moore and Sinead O\u2019Connor were also performing. O\u2019Connor chose the four to to tour with her as her backup singers after this, and they also opened up for the artist on the Gospel Oak Tour. This extended into other opportunities, including touring with Babba Maal, and recording tracks with the likes of Peter Gabriel, Joni Mitchell, and the Chieftains. \u00a0 Since those days, the Screaming Orphans have become a well-known band in their own right, appearing on both the iTunes World Music charts and the Billboard World Albums charts, among many other accolades. They have put out 15 albums over the years \u2013 all their own one-of-a-kind recipe of pop/rock with Celtic influence, and this year they are releasing a Christmas single, \"Song We Used To Sing\u201d for the holiday season. \u00a0 The single reflects the unusual time we find ourselves in this holiday\u2014often isolated from our loved ones at the time we are used to gathering for storytelling, sharing memories, and celebrating Christmas. It calls forth a nostalgic feel with it\u2019s simple arrangement and lovely harmonies. An original track, the band collaborated with songwriter John Spillane to craft a holiday song that focuses in on warm memories and togetherness at a time these ideas are most often highlighted. It\u2019s a pretty song with a message of peace and hope that helps ease the sting of being apart at Christmastime. Not only is it especially timely for 2020, but this thoughtful tune will hold up well for future holiday seasons. \u00a0 Find out more about Screaming Orphans at\u00a0screamingorphans.com. \u00a0 If you hear music you love in the Celtic Christmas Podcast, then support the artists.

We hope you enjoy this new episode of \"A Musical Theatre Podcast.\" In the year 1966, many iconic characters arrived on Broadway, among them: Mame Dennis, Don Quixote, and the focus of today's episode, Charity Hope Valentine. Her musical SWEET CHARITY allowed both Bob Fosse to continue his journey as a daring theatre artist as well as countless women to shine in the title role. One of them joins us this week. Dylis Croman (Broadway's CHICAGO, DANCIN', FOSSE) is a true triple threat who learned the Fosse style at the hand of the great Ann Reinking. Tune in as Dylis shares thoughts on her time with the 2000s revival of SWEET CHARITY and tells one of the greatest stories we've ever heard on the podcast. Follow Dylis on Instagram at @dycro33  and look for her as Roxie Hart in CHICAGO this Labor Day Weekend at the Ambassador Theater on Broadway.

On this episode, MBW founder Tim Ingham speaks to AI expert, and the CEO of LyricStudio, Dr. Maya Ackerman.------Bloody Elon Musk. Not content with doing beastly things to Twitter (like, erm, marginally improving the user experience), he's also triggered the actual beginning of the actual end of the world. Well, not directly. But Musk was one of the co-founders and funders of San Francisco-headquartered OpenAI, which is the progenitor of ChatGPT \u2013 the AI-powered online tool that can not only research and regurgitate online facts, but also weave that regurgitation in a variety of generated tones and styles. Some tech experts are so impressed with ChatGPT, they say, in just a few more iterations, it will become a serious challenger to (and perhaps even surpass the usefulness of) Google, and turn the business of online search upside down. (The next chapter in this sci-fi novel: ChatGPT gains sentience, turns our own long-trusted devices against us, and subjugates the human race. But that's probably still a few years away, so chill out, and, as Warren Zevon famously recommended, Enjoy every sandwich.)The music industry is actually a little ahead of the curve on this topic. Because language-based 'generative AI' platforms are already transforming this business in a meaningful way \u2013 in the world of lyric writing.LyricStudio, owned by California-headquartered parent WaveAI, produces original lyrics for songwriters in a style that mimics their own. In this sense, it's 'assistive AI' \u2013 a human companion, a muse. \"When it comes to curing writer's block, there is nothing as powerful as LyricStudio,\" its website boasts. LyricStudio's popularity is already mind-boggling: to date, it has been responsible for 'assisting' the creation of over a million songs, from over a million songwriters, musicians and producers. At least 15% of the people that use it, say LyricStudio, are professional music-makers.One of those artists, rapper Curtiss King, released a No.1 album (on the US iTunes chart) last summer \u2013 with lyrics written/'assisted' by LyricStudio.On this Music Business Worldwide podcast, the co-founder and CEO of WaveAI/LyricStudio, Dr Maya Ackerman, discusses the future for AI and music... especially when it comes to lyric writing.Ackerman has some powerful credentials: she is a professor of AI at the Computer Science and Engineering Department at Santa Clara University, as well as a singer, songwriter and music producer. She earned her PhD in Computer Science from the University of Waterloo, held Postdoctoral Fellowships at Caltech and UC San Diego, and has published over 50 peer-reviewed research publications.We ask her all about LyricStudio and the moral and artistic quandaries presented by the use of 'generative AI' in music-making.

He also thinks it might be the industry's savior.On this MBW Podcast, Cohen \u2013 Global Head of Music at YouTube \u2013\u00a0explains his fears over short-form video platforms that fail to push users into deeper engagement with music and artist content.\"Short-form video that doesn't lead anywhere is the most dangerous thing I've seen the music business face in a long time,\" says Cohen. Cohen believes that, if left unchecked, the rise and rise in music consumption on this type of short-form video platform could become one of the music industry's \"biggest crises to date\".(Cohen doesn't mention any particular platforms, but it's worth noting that there's been a lot of headlines written on MBW this year about TikTok's failure \u2013 so far, at least \u2013 to launch a connected music service to its main platform.)Cohen argues that YouTube's approach with its YouTube Shorts product offers an important distinction: A platform that hooks you in with short-form video \u2013 but then nudges would-be fans to longer/deeper audio and visual content about artists on both YouTube and YouTube Music.Cohen lays out three problems he sees growing to a head in the current music business:Problem No.1, he says, is an expectation for modern artists to spend a significant amount of their time, creativity and energy on certain social media platforms \u2013 platforms that in Cohen\u2019s view rarely lead to deeper fandom amongst consumers;Problem No.2, he says, lies with consumers themselves \u2013 and his concern that the next generation of fans aren\u2019t currently delving deep into artists, their stories, and their catalogs;And Problem No.3, says Cohen, lies at the door of record companies, who are struggling to break artists with regularity in this current digital environment.He believes the migration of fans away from long-standing social media platforms towards short-form video services is a major opportunity for the music business to foster true fandom in a vast potential audience globally.But he also warns the music business to drop its current \"euphoric\" state, and think hard about how short-form video's role must evolve to best serve the next generation of fans and artists.The MBW Podcast is supported by Voly Music.The Music Business Worldwide Podcast is supported by Voly Music."

As he explains on this MBW Podcast, Sundin has since 2019 been CEO of Pophouse Entertainment \u2013 the Stockholm-based company behind a number of successful ventures with ABBA.The most radical of those ventures is ABBA Voyage, the technologically stunning 'virtual concert residency' from the legendary Swedish band that has been playing to hundreds of thousands of wowed ticketholders in London since May this year. Portraying the group as they appeared in 1977, the show has been created by ABBA in conjunction with Pophouse and Industrial Light & Magic, the Disney-owned visual effects company most famous for working on Star Wars properties through the decades. (Founding ABBA member Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus is a shareholder in, and board member of, Pophouse.)PopHouse recently got even more interesting from a music business perspective, buying a majority stake in the rights of catalogs created by names such as Swedish House Mafia and Avicii. On this podcast, Sundin tells us how Pophouse plans to \"amplify\" the artist brands behind this catalog music using lessons learnt from working with ABBA. He also discusses why he's confident, after a major financial investment, that the ABBA Voyage show will soon become profitable, go global \u2013 and change the face of 'virtual' artist performances forever more. And he explains why he believes that the major record companies will soon switch their smartest executives (if they haven't already) to focus more on catalog, rather than frontline, music.The MBW Podcast is supported by Voly Music.The Music Business Worldwide Podcast is supported by Voly Music."

For most kids raised in conservative Christian households, mainstream music was forbidden - if teens were going to rock, they needed to do it God\u2019s way. And the place to find Christian rock gods? Youth group.  In the first episode of Rock that Doesn\u2019t Roll, hosts Andrew Gill (producer, Sound Opinions) and Leah Payne (author, God Gave Rock and Roll to You) talk with comedian Steve Hernandez and author Tyler Huckabee finding music, meaning, and identity in 1990s youth group culture. Youth ministry consultant Mark Oestreicher explains the world of high-production youth groups, where rock shows reigned as the best way to draw a crowd of teens into evangelical churches. In this episode, the music of Delirious?, DCTalk, and Relient K bring kids in the doors of the youth group room. But it couldn\u2019t always keep them. Steve and Tyler share their stories of loving - and in some cases leaving - the Christian rock scene that raised them. But even when you take the kid out of the youth group, it turns out that you may not be able to take the youth group music out of the kid.  Do you have a story to share about rocking out to your favorite Christian band in youth group? Leave us a message at (629) 777-6336.

But was the music and the message enough to keep the evangelical faith? In episode two, hosts Andrew Gill (producer, Sound Opinions) and Leah Payne (author, God Gave Rock and Roll to You) follow three Christian punk rock stories from Dr. Bradley Onishi of Axis Mundi Media, author D.L. Mayfield, and Tim Whitaker of The New Evangelicals as they share their stories of loving, leaving, or holding on to evangelical Christianity - and the music that fueled their teenaged devotion.

With special insight from Christian music industry veteran promoter Chris Hauser, hosts Andrew Gill (producer, Sound Opinions) and Leah Payne (author, God Gave Rock and Roll to You) follow the CCM aspirations of comedian Kevin James Thornton and artist/faith leader Sunia Won Gibbs. The two Christian music fans hoped to find stardom and a sense of the divine, but found many trials and travails awaited those who took the stage as evangelical pop stars. Along the way, Sunia and Kevin discover that while not every aspiring CCM artist \u201cmade it,\u201d the world of Christian music certainly made them.

For mainstream music fans, tastemakers included record store clerks of 1990s indie music stores, or retail juggernauts like Tower Records and Wherehouse - the kind of superfans depicted by Jack Black in High Fidelity. But for many evangelical teens of the 1990s, record stores were not the place to find kid-tested, parent-approved music. For that, Christian teens usually had to go to Christian bookstores. There, among the Bibles and Precious Moments dolls and Christian-themed t-shirts, they found the records that defined their adolescence. Their guides on the journey? Bookstore Guys. This week on Rock that Doesn\u2019t Roll: with insight from ethnomusicologist Andrew Mall (author, God Rock, Inc.), hosts Andrew Gill (producer, Sound Opinions) and Leah Payne (author, God Gave Rock & Roll to You) follow the story of John J. Thompson (True Tunes podcast), a Christian bookstore guy who dreamed of transcending the Christian bookstore and creating a music store - along with a thriving artistic community - for fans of critically-acclaimed Christian rock.

Sixpence None the Richer. Creed. Evanescence. Lifehouse. Owl City. Paramore. They all had different sounds, but they left listeners wondering: are they - or aren't they - \u201cChristian music?\u201d This week on Rock that Doesn't Roll: does an artist who identifies as Christian have to brand their music as such? With insight from David Dark (author, We Become What We Normalize), hosts Andrew Gill (producer, Sound Opinions) and Leah Payne (author, God Gave Rock & Roll to You) follow the story of Jon Foreman, a pastor\u2019s kid from Carlsbad, California whose band Switchfoot created songs that resonated with youth group kids and climbed the Top 40 charts. Were they, or were they not, a Christian band? We explore efforts to rethink Christian music, and how mainstream superstars U2 led the way for bands like Switchfoot to wrestle with the marketing category of \u201cChristian\u201d - and find an enduring connection with their fans along the way.

The season finale of\u00a0Rock That Doesn't Roll\u00a0explores the idea that maybe, just maybe, the key to getting over angst about Christian rock isn't rejecting it or avoiding it, but coming to peace with the person you were when you fell in love with it. With insight from historian Randall J. Stephens (author,\u00a0The Devil's Music), hosts Andrew Gill (producer,\u00a0Sound Opinions) and Leah Payne (author,\u00a0God Gave Rock & Roll to You) follow the story of David Bazan, a Pentecostal pastor's kid-turned-indie rocker who spent decades running from his CCM past.\u00a0Along the way, Bazan founded\u00a0Pedro the Lion, and gained critical acclaim, but his\u00a0fraught\u00a0relationship with evangelical\u00a0Christianity and the world of Contemporary Christian Music haunted him. In the end, Bazan suggests that one way to make peace with a CCM past is to learn to be \u201cthe billy of your actual hills.\u201d  Thanks for joining us for the first season - it\u2019s been an incredible journey.

        "episode_description": "A BODY SCAN SCRIPT Begin by making yourself comfortable. Sit in a chair and allow your back to be straight, but not  stiff, with your feet on the ground. You could also do this practice standing or if you prefer, you can  lie down and have your head supported. Your hands could be resting gently in your lap or at your  side. Allow your eyes to close, or to remain open with a soft gaze.  Take several long, slow, deep breaths. Breathing in fully and exhaling slowly. Breathe in through  your nose and out through your nose or mouth. Feel your stomach expand on an inhale and relax  and let go as you exhale.  Begin to let go of noises around you. Begin to shift your attention from outside to inside yourself. If  you are distracted by sounds in the room, simply notice this and bring your focus back to your  breathing.  Now slowly bring your attention down to your feet. Begin observing sensations in your feet. You  might want to wiggle your toes a little, feeling your toes against your socks or shoes. Just notice,  without judgment. You might imagine sending your breath down to your feet, as if the breath is  traveling through the nose to the lungs and through the abdomen all the way down to your feet.  And then back up again out through your nose and lungs. Perhaps you don't feel anything at all.  That is fine, too. Just allow yourself to feel the sensation of not feeling anything.  When you are ready, allow your feet to dissolve in your mind\u2019s eye and move your attention up to  your ankles, calves, knees and thighs. Observe the sensations you are experiencing throughout  your legs. Breathe into and breathe out of the legs. If your mind begins to wander during this  exercise, gently notice this without judgment and bring your mind back to noticing the sensations  in your legs. If you notice any discomfort, pain or stiffness, don't judge this. Just simply notice it.  Observe how all sensations rise and fall, shift and change moment to moment. Notice how no  sensation is permanent. Just observe and allow the sensations to be in the moment, just as they  are. Breathe into and out from the legs.  Then on the next out breath, allow the legs to dissolve in your mind. And move to the sensations in  your lower back and pelvis. Softening and releasing as you breathe in and out. Slowly move your  attention up to your mid back and upper back. Become curious about the sensations here. You  may become aware of sensations in the muscle, temperature or points of contact with furniture or  the bed. With each outbreath, you may let go of tension you are carrying. And then very gently  shift your focus to your stomach and all the internal organs here. Perhaps you notice the feeling of  clothing, the process of digestion or the belly rising or falling with each breath. If you notice  opinions arising about these areas, gently let these go and return to noticing sensations.  As you continue to breathe, bring your awareness to the chest and heart region and just notice  your heartbeat. Observe how the chest rises during the inhale and how the chest falls during the  exhale. Let go of any judgments that may arise. On the next outbreath, shift the focus to your hands  and fingertips. See if you can channel your breathing into and out of this area as if you are  breathing into and out from your hands. If your mind wanders, gently bring it back to the  sensations in your hands."

It was a symphonic premiere that almost didn\u2019t take place, though, in the end, the show did go on.\u00a0 Nevertheless, the authorities (the Soviet authorities, notable for their heavy blue serge suits, vodka breaths, and deficient senses of humor) did everything in their power to squash the symphony out of existence.\u00a0 In this they failed miserably, and Shostakovich\u2019s Thirteenth is today acknowledged as not just one of Shostakovich\u2019s supreme masterworks but as one of the most musically and politically important works composed during the twentieth century.\u00a0 A Good Communist During the late 1950s, Shostakovich was increasingly used by the Soviet authorities as a sort of artistic \u201cfigure head,\u201d meant to represent the supposedly \u201cfree\u201d Soviet intelligentsia.\u00a0 In 1960, the First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union \u2013 Nikita Khrushchev (1894-1971) \u2013 decided to make the 54-year-old Shostakovich the chairman of the newly founded RSFSR, the Russian Union of Composers.\u00a0 [\u2026] The post Music History Monday: Shostakovich Symphony No. 13 first appeared on Robert Greenberg."

First things first: let us pronounce this fine man\u2019s surname properly.\u00a0 It is not pronounced as \u201cmoo-g.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cMoo-g\u201d is a sound made by a cow after she painfully stubs her hoof.\u00a0 Despite its double-o, the name is pronounced \u201cmogue,\u201d as in \u201cvogue.\u201d Moog didn\u2019t invent the sound synthesizer.\u00a0 Rather, he (and his inventing \u201cpartners,\u201d the composer Herbert Arnold \u201cHerb\u201d Deutsch, 1932-2022 and, to a somewhat lesser degree, Wendy Carlos, born 1939) democratized the thing, making it affordable, portable, and playable enough to be bought and used by anyone who could get around a piano-like keyboard.

No, he wanted to \u201chuddle under the blankets and stay warm,\u201d he would say. It was nicer there. Easier there. But another part of him knew he wasn\u2019t created to feel nice, to have it easy. \u201cI have to go to work \u2014 as a human being,\u201d he said, hauling his feet up and onto the floor.This is the internal back and forth so many of us have every morning. Not Arnold Schwarzennegger though. \u201cMy rule in the morning is, \u2018don\u2019t think,\u2019\u201d he said on a recent episode of the Daily Stoic podcast. To prevent the internal back and forth, the negotiating, the rationalizing, the justifying, Arnold recommended, \u201cMake it a rule where you say, \u2018Okay, there are certain things that I would do before I start thinking\u2026I\u2019m going to work out before I start thinking.\u2019 Don\u2019t think. Just go. Get out on a walk. Get on that bicycle. Get to the gym.\u201d--And in today's Daily Stoic video excerpt, Ryan outlines 14 small mindset changes. For the most part, we can\u2019t change the world. We can\u2019t change the fundamental facts of existence\u2013like the fact that we\u2019re going to die. We can\u2019t change other people. So one way to think about Stoicism itself then is as a collection of mindset shifts for the many situations that life seems to thrust us in. Indeed, Seneca\u2019s Letters, Marcus Aurelius\u2019 Meditations, and Epictetus\u2019 Discourses are filled with passages, anecdotes, and quotes which force a shift in perspective.\u2709\ufe0f\u00a0Sign up for the Daily Stoic email:\u00a0https://dailystoic.com/dailyemail\ud83c\udfdb Check out the\u00a0Daily Stoic Store\u00a0for Stoic inspired products, signed books, and more.\ud83d\udcf1 Follow us:\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Twitter,\u00a0YouTube,\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0FacebookSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info."

On the street, people seemed to love her boldly striped shirts and sweats, always asking \u201cWhere can I get that?\u201d whenever she wore them. Three years later, Paige opened her first store in Venice Beach, and then she relied on word of mouth \u2013 and shrewd negotiating tactics with landlords \u2013 to launch more new locations. Despite early struggles with managing her team and an onerous trademark battle with Adidas, Paige grew Aviator Nation into a multi-million dollar brand - that still makes all its clothes in California.This episode was produced by Alex Cheng with music by Ramtin Arablouei.Edited by Neva Grant, with research from Rommel Wood.Our engineer was Josephine Nyounai.You can follow HIBT on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0&\u00a0Instagram, and email us at\u00a0hibt@id.wondery.com.See Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info."

After quitting a high-powered job in tech, she dived into doing after-school projects with her kids, like making puppets out of Styrofoam or combining baking soda and vinegar to see what happens. When she discovered that other parents liked these projects too, she decided to create a subscription box company that sent out science and crafts kits every month. She gathered kids in her garage to test-market her ideas, and pitched her plan over and over to investors in Silicon Valley, where her car was \u201cthe only minivan in the parking lot.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Today KiwiCo is the leading subscription box for kids, and has shipped over 50 million crates worldwide.This episode was produced by Kerry Thompson with music by Ramtin Arablouei.\u00a0It was edited by Neva Grant with research help from Carla Esteves.

That weekend, Dan, his brother Mike, and several other longtime friends planned a camping trip for the opening of fishing season. Dan and Mike were raised as avid outdoorsmen, and opening weekend was a big deal. While this was their first time visiting Gunn Lake, this annual trip was something they looked forward to all year. The area where the men were camping was very rural and densely wooded. It wasn't a campground with amenities; they were roughing it, but that was how Dan and his buddies liked it. The men set up camp, spent many hours fishing on the lake, drank some beers, and seemed to be having a great time. However, by Sunday morning, Dan had vanished. They found a canoe in the water with some of his fishing supplies still inside. It looked like he had been plucked from that boat, leaving his items undisturbed. Despite extensive searches of the lake and surrounding wilderness, no trace of Dan Maleska has ever surfaced. The circumstances have left his loved ones to wonder if the scene was staged and Dan planned to disappear.If you have any information regarding the disappearance of Dan Maleska, please call the Itasca County Sheriff's Office at (218) 326-3477.This episode was sponsored by:GoodRX- For big savings on your\u00a0everyday prescriptions, go toGoodrx.com/vanished.\u00a0Audible- Visit\u00a0Audible.com/MIA\u00a0or text MIA to 500-500 to try Audible free for 30 days.Zbiotics- Go to\u00a0Zbiotics.com/VANISHED\u00a0to get 15% off your first order when you use code VANISHED at checkout.Doordash- Our listeners can get 50% off, up to a $10 value when you spend $15 or more.

In the days leading up to March 9, Kay-Alana had not been sleeping well, and she didn\u2019t seem quite like herself. Witnesses in the towns of Hockley and Tomball, Texas, interacted with Kay-Alana in the early morning hours of March 10. She had been asking people if she could sleep in their driveways. By this time, Kay-Alana\u2019s phone had died. Around 6 AM, a homeowner in the Holly Creek Estates subdivision in Tomball, Texas, noticed Kay-Alana\u2019s car in their driveway, and she was asleep inside. The homeowner decided to call someone from their homeowner\u2019s association and other neighbors. They gathered around Kay-Alana\u2019s car and attempted to wake her. Kay-Alana was scared and decided to drive her car away, but they blocked her. Then, an officer from Harris County broke Kay-Alana\u2019s driver-side window. She bolted, first by driving her car through the yard, out through some farmland, and eventually into the woods, where the vehicle got stuck. With deputies behind her on foot, she decided to run. Kay-Alana dropped her phone along the way and later removed her shoes, full of glass from the broken window. In the days that followed, Kay-Alana\u2019s loved ones began to compare notes and came to believe that she was suffering a mental health crisis that night. Despite extensive searches of the area where Kay-Alana was last seen, no trace of her, other than her phone and shoes, has ever been found.If you have any information about Kay-Alana\u2019s disappearance, please contact the Harris County Sheriff\u2019s Office at 713-755-7427.Photo Credit:\u00a0James Blaign RamboThis episode was sponsored by:Zbiotics- Go to\u00a0Zbiotics.com/VANISHED\u00a0to get 15% off your first order when you use code VANISHED at checkout.If you have a missing loved one that you would like to have featured on the show, please fill out our\u00a0case submission form.Follow The Vanished on social media at:FacebookInstagramTwitterPatreonSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info."

Kay-Alana\u2019s friend, Brittany, noticed that she hadn\u2019t been sleeping well, and something appeared to be troubling Kay-Alana. The following morning, Brittany left for work, believing Kay-Alana was asleep. As the day wore on, Brittany kept trying to contact Kay-Alana, but something was off with the way that her text messages were going through. She attempted to reach Kay-Alana via phone and Facetime video calls. She eventually reached Kay-Alana, but something still wasn\u2019t quite right, and she didn\u2019t know where her friend was. Brittany enlisted the help of Kay-Alana\u2019s boyfriend, James, who went out searching for her that night. He stopped at all of Kay-Alana\u2019s familiar places with no luck. They later learned that Kay-Alana had planned to visit a friend in Austin, about a four-hour drive from Brittany\u2019s home. Where along that 245-mile trip could something have gone wrong? Did Kay-Alana get into an accident? Had she run out of gas? They searched frantically throughout the night, and by the next morning, stories began to emerge about Kay-Alana that seemed so out of character for her.

He was last seen walking toward his truck on the morning of August 15, shortly before the bar closed. After that, the trail ends.

He had given all his belongings to a woman he had recently met. She claimed that he had offered the items for her hand in marriage while on a spiritual journey. But then, Josh was picked up by park rangers inside Olympic National Park, walking barefoot early one morning. They dropped him off at a general store and watched him walk away on foot. That is the last official, confirmed sighting of Joshua Simiskey. However, there were other unconfirmed sightings of Josh that seemed to point to a voluntary disappearance. Others believed that Josh was in a vulnerable mental state and was possibly coerced into giving his valuables away. Four years have gone by, and Josh Simiskey has never surfaced. What is known about the circumstances leading up to Josh's disappearance has left his loved ones with more questions than answers.

In 2007, Alison Krauss and Robert Plant released their Grammy-winning album, Raising Sand. The critically acclaimed pairing produced studio gold which later turned into platinum. Fourteen years later, the duo released their second album, Raise the Roof. Could they replicate the magic? Listen in to find out! Singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist, Matt Saxton from East Sussex, United Kingdom, joins Team Derringer as special guest-host to explore the Plant and Krauss\u2019 fantastic interpretation of blues, country, soul, gospel, and old-timey songs. To top off the winning formula, the pair recruited Grammy award winning T. Bone Burnett, a highly successful record producer, guitarist, and songwriter. \u00a0Burnett is known for musical endeavors in films such as O Brother Where Art Thou?, Cold Mountain, Walk the Line, and Crazy Heart.

The transient nature of her childhood prevented Tina from feeling a sense of belonging and she often felt insulated from the outside world. To entertain herself, she played music with her family members and wrote her first song at age 11. She blossomed as a musician shortly after university when a friend\u2019s brother, a music producer, wanted to record her. Tina expected her songs to find their home in the church halls she was so familiar with, but she soon found herself performing the open mic circuit in and around London. After connecting with producer Trevor Michael, Tina found her musical voice and solidly established her sound. Tina is a master storyteller. Her songs run the gamut from the deeply painful experiences to the hope one can find in the simple things of life.

        "episode_description": "If you're a long-time Derringer Discoveries listener, you'll recall that In Episode 19, we weighed in on The Beatles' 10 Worst Songs. In response to that episode, Sammy Vulcano, a solo recording artist from the Syracuse, New York (US) area, reached out to Team Derringer. Sammy shared that he is a superfan of The Beatles. He told Team Derringer that he had recently combined his songwriting talents with those of his lifelong friend and fellow musician, Anthony Micaroni, to write, record, and release a trilogy of songs about The Beatles from 1962 to 1965. Intrigued by this concept, Team Derringer decided to explore the collaboration between Sammy and Anthony and invited them to join Team Derringer (Laura, Paul, Alton, and Dave) as they delve into this period of The Beatles' legacy -- a time that is often overshadowed by the brilliance of The Beatles' catalog released after 1965. Assisted by special guests Sammy and Anthony, Team Derringer shares the tale of The Beatles in Hamburg 1962, along with snippets of their biggest hits from 1962 to 1965.\u00a0 The Beatles had just one hit in 1962 and it was only in the UK. They didn't conquer the US until January 1964, but by 1965, they were dominating the music charts worldwide. Join Team Derringer and their guests as they discover obscure, interesting trivia about The Beatles. Along the way, you'll hear snippets of The Beatles' two hit singles sung with German lyrics. Additionally, Team Derringer, Sammy, and Anthony will discuss Kurt Cobain's posthumous hit single, a cover of Sammy's favorite 1963 song by The Beatles.\u00a0 Kurt's cover has streamed almost 59 million times! And of course, Team Derringer will play snippets of the trilogy of songs by Sammy and Anthony that sparked the idea for this episode. These three songs by Sammy Vulcano and Anthony Micaroni are available on all the major digital streaming platforms, such as Spotify. Derringer Discoveries is the curator of a popular Spotify playlist called The Beatles Inspired.\u00a0 If you are a recording artist or a listener who knows of a song that belongs on this playlist, subscribe to our free newsletter at https://www.derringerdiscoveries.com and then send us a link to the song at feedback@derringerdiscoveries.com.\u00a0 Most likely we'll include it on the playlist!

        "episode_description": "On our 6th edition of our monthly sidecast, First Concert Memories, we welcome our friend Markus \"The Darkus\" Goldman from 93.3 WMMR in Philadelphia and The Imbalanced History of Rock n Roll Podcast to talk about an epic night in the history of rock music. On June 5, 1983, an up and coming back from Ireland had decided to film their concert at the Red Rock Amphitheater in Morrison, Colorado just north of Denver. However, heavy rains and storms were expected and members of the management and crew didn't think it was a good idea for that day. Many ticket holders were convinced to stay home and the band had to go on the radio to implore folks to come to the show. The show was delayed and opening act The Alarm didn't even play due to the weather. But in the end, the show went on, it was filmed and it changed the fortunes of the band for for millions of members of the MTV generation. Yes, it was U2 that played that night, recording the entire show that would eventually end up on MTV Saturday nights and form part of the live album Under A Blood Red Sky. But the video for Sunday Bloody Sunday would get into heavy rotation on MTV, showing Bono waving a white flag with bonfires atop the natural mountain formation. It made for an otherworldly scene that helped propel U2 to superstar status in the US and set them up to become legends. Hear Markus talk about braving the elements, having security keep him from being crushed against the barrier, his favorite moments and many remarkable memories of a teenager seeing U2 in that incredible setting.

Thought The Wolf had to leave Amsterdam for his homeland early in 2023, he didn't sell all the concert tickets he bought. He made a trip back in April to see Metallica on the first 2 nights of their No Repeat Weekend Tour. And The Wolf met up in Amsterdam with Action Jackson over the summer to take him to his first ever Iron Maiden concert. It was so great they went to see the boys again in Antwerp and then enjoyed some unexpected encounters at the hotel. Plus our host took The Wolfcub to see KISS one last time. We love talking with the talented musicians who make the rock music we love and we were honored to host an array of great guests from up and coming artists like Jimmy Maddon to legends like Terry Reid and Jim McCarty of The Yardbirds. Talking to Steve Kilbey of The Church was a treat and getting to know rockers in their prime like Scott Holiday of Rival Sons and Oliver Wakeman who we'll be seeing for years to come And stay tuned as we unveil our Top 10 episodes (by download) for 2023.

In episode 172, I started my investigation of what were the favourite albums of the year from some great music writers and broadcasters. If you haven't caught up with that one, check out what Brian Nankervis, Jeff Jenkins and Pat Monaghan had to say (as well as a couple of great emails from listeners to the show).  Concluding this investigation for episode 173, I speak with Ian McFarlane (author of The Encyclopedia of Australian Rock and Pop) and Billy Pinnell (presenter of The Album Show on EON-FM / MMM-FM). Also, podcast listener (and huge supporter of the Melbournel music scene), Mark Andrew sent me some audio feedback. Once again, get out your pens and paper to jot down some great recommendations to follow up on.  I reiterate from last time, I'm grateful to everyone who joined me on the show this year, downloaded any episodes, or told their friends the show was worthy of their time. You're all grouse.

La continuaci\u00f3n al \u00e1lbum debut de Rodrigo en 2021, SOUR, que obtuvo 4 veces la certificaci\u00f3n de platino y rompi\u00f3 r\u00e9cords,   Producido y coescrito por Daniel Nigro (tambi\u00e9n socio creativo principal de Rodrigo en SOUR), \"vampire\" marca un cambio en comparaci\u00f3n con el minimalismo on\u00edrico de \u00e9xitos anteriores como su sencillo de gran \u00e9xito \"drivers license\", certificado 5 veces platino. En ese sentido, \"vampire\" comienza con una intensidad susurrante antes de explotar en un \u00e9pico descomunal construido sobre ritmos de bater\u00eda palpitantes y un trabajo de piano magn\u00edficamente fren\u00e9tico. A medida que la canci\u00f3n adquiere una velocidad, Rodrigo revela su elevada sofisticaci\u00f3n vocal y l\u00edrica, tejiendo una historia sobre el tipo de romance t\u00f3xico que agota tu propia energ\u00eda vital.  \"Estaba molesta por una cierta situaci\u00f3n y fui al estudio sola, me sent\u00e9 frente al piano de cola y los acordes, la melod\u00eda y las letras simplemente salieron de m\u00ed, casi como una experiencia fuera del cuerpo\", recuerda. \"Es una canci\u00f3n sobre sentirse confundido y herido, y al principio pens\u00e9 que iba a ser una balada de piano. Pero cuando Dan y yo empezamos a trabajar en ella, yuxtapusimos las letras con estos grandes tambores y cambios de tempo locos. Ahora es como una canci\u00f3n de desamor con la que puedes bailar\".  Dirigido por la famosa artista/directora/fot\u00f3grafa Petra Collins, el video de \"vampire\" hizo su estreno mundial en MTV Live, MTVU y en la red global de canales de MTV, as\u00ed como en los carteles de Times Square de Paramount. Collins anteriormente dirigi\u00f3 el video de \"brutal\", certificado 2 veces platino, y recibi\u00f3 una nominaci\u00f3n al GRAMMY\u00ae por su trabajo en el video de \"good 4 u\", certificado 4 veces platino y que encabez\u00f3 la lista Billboard Hot 100."

La luna y Venus trabajan juntos para que los aspectos clave del amor y la vida dom\u00e9stica funcionen bien. Este trabajo representa todos los niveles del amor: liberar a las personas con amor, atraer el amor a tu vida y el amor propio. Muchos astr\u00f3logos creen que la luna de sangre puede hacer que tus emociones den un giro, y eso es lo que me pareci\u00f3 que representaba mejor este trabajo\u201d. El nuevo tema sigue a la anterior propuesta de Red Moon In Venus, \"I Wish You Roses\", que lleg\u00f3 junto a un v\u00eddeo dirigido por Cho Gi-Seok y fue elogiado por PAPER como \"lujoso\" e \"inmaculadamente producido\u201d.  Uchis entr\u00f3 en el proceso de grabaci\u00f3n con la intenci\u00f3n de crear un \u00e1lbum que se sintiera atemporal, que pudiera disfrutarse en cualquier momento y lugar y que siguiera siendo significativo a lo largo de los a\u00f1os para ella y sus fans. Red Moon In Venus flota entre el soul, el R&B, el pop, la m\u00fasica urbana y las texturas m\u00e1s experimentales. El resultado es un \u00e1lbum que, como Uchis ha llegado a perfeccionar a lo largo de su cat\u00e1logo, trasciende g\u00e9neros o clasificaciones, un puro reflejo de su alma.  El a\u00f1o pasado, Uchis gan\u00f3 tres Billboard Latin Awards, dos Billboard Music Awards y un American Music Award. En 2021, Uchis se llev\u00f3 a casa su primer Premio Billboard de la M\u00fasica Latina por su \u00e1lbum en espa\u00f1ol aclamado por la cr\u00edtica, Sin Miedo (del Amor y Otros Demonios) \u221e, lanzado en 2020, que dio lugar al \u00e9xito arrollador y l\u00edder de las listas, \"telepat\u00eda\", que se ha reproducido m\u00e1s de 2 mil millones de veces hasta la fecha y es la canci\u00f3n en espa\u00f1ol con una mayor estancia en el Billboard Hot 100 por un artista en solitario esta d\u00e9cada con una racha de 23 semanas. Ese mismo a\u00f1o, se llev\u00f3 a casa su primer premio Grammy, los Premios Nuestra Tierra y los Premios Juventud de Univision, fue portada de Office Magazine, actu\u00f3 en \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\" y realiz\u00f3 una gira por escenarios de toda Norteam\u00e9rica con Tyler, the Creator.  Criada entre Virginia y Colombia, Kali Uchis salt\u00f3 a la fama con Por Vida en 2015, al que sigui\u00f3 su \u00e1lbum debut de 2018, Isolation, que recibi\u00f3 elogios generalizados de la cr\u00edtica y apareci\u00f3 en las listas Best Of de Rolling Stone, Pitchfork, NPR, Vulture y muchos m\u00e1s. Uchis ha colaborado y compartido escenario con SZA, Gorillaz, Jorja Smith, Diplo, Major Lazer, Snoop Dogg, Kaytranada, Leon Bridges y muchos m\u00e1s, y ha realizado giras por todo el mundo, con actuaciones muy elogiadas como cabeza de cartel en Tropicalia, Coachella, Governors Ball, Bonnaroo, Austin City Limits, Lollapalooza y muchos otros."

John Alexander.\u00a0Alexander and colleagues searched for hidden evidence of UFO crash retrieval/reverse engineering programs but didn't find any.\u00a0For years afterward, Alexander was skeptical whenever \"crashed saucers\" were mentioned, but what about now?\u00a0 His detractors refer to Col. Alexander as \"Dr. Death\u201d. He is purported to have psychic powers and mind control abilities, is often associated with the shadowy \"Aviary\" group of UFO insiders, and is viewed with fear and suspicion whenever he attends a UFO conference, on a par with the Men in Black or Darth Vader. Alexander chuckles about how he is perceived by ufologists.\u00a0He led special forces teams into combat during the Vietnam conflict, was involved with the US Army's remote viewing program, became the head of Non-Lethal Weapons research at Los Alamos lab, and in the 90's, hooked up with NIDS, the National Institute for Discovery Science which was created and funded by Las Vegas billionaire\u00a0Robert Bigelow. Alexander was with Bigelow when the businessman purchased what came to be known as Skinwalker Ranch.\u00a0 In this episode, Dr. Alexander reveals to George and Jeremy how his view of the \u201ccrashed saucers\u201d story has evolved, shares his impressions from the recent Sol conference, discusses previous attempts to achieve UFO transparency through congressional action, and gives his assessment of fellow intelligence officer Col.

The current wave of whistleblowers is not the first to spill secrets about UFO crashes and reverse engineering efforts by military contractors. In 1997, a high-ranking Army Intelligence official Colonel Phillip Corso shocked the world with his account about a Pentagon office charged with dribbling bits and pieces of alien technology out to major corporations and labs. The tech, Corso said, came from crashes near Roswell New Mexico. Corso's book \"The Day After Roswell\" became a huge bestseller in 1997, the 50th anniversary of the Roswell events.\u00a0 But five years before he released a book, long before he was known to anyone in the UFO field, Corso told his story to George Knapp. Corso also sat down for two lengthy interviews conducted by personnel associated with NIDS, the National Institute for Discovery Science. The interviews were recorded, though the recordings were never released. In this episode of WEAPONIZED, Jeremy and George revisit the Corso tale and take a deep dive into the unreleased Corso tapes.\u00a0 \u2022\u2022\u2022\u00a0 GOT A TIP?

How could we tell the difference between what we perceive to be the real world and a digital re-creation? While still in his teens, Jules Urbach (Founder and CEO of OTOY, Inc) designed and sold hugely successful video games. He declined an invitation to attend Harvard, and focused instead on the development of cutting-edge technologies that subsequently revolutionized movies, television, and streaming networks, and fueled the explosion of virtual reality endeavors. His companies have earned Oscars and accolades for the digital effects in hugely successful film franchises (the Marvel movies, Avatar, Disney) but his most important accomplishments are still unfolding. Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality hold enormous promise for our planet, but Jules thinks the day is coming when we may not be able to tell the difference between real life and its artificial alternatives. It is likely that many people might prefer to live in a virtual world, though Jules hopes that isn't the case.\u00a0 In this mind-bending discussion with Jeremy and George, Jules speculates on the future of human evolution, how a melding of people and machines is already underway, and where it might lead. Virtual Reality tech, combined with powerful A.I. could eventually mean that humans could evolve into non-physical super-beings, real but invisible. And if there are vastly older alien civilizations elsewhere in the universe, they might have made a similar transformation eons ago.\u00a0 Learn more about Jules\u2019 company OTOY here :\u00a0https://OTOY.com\u00a0 \u00a0\u2022\u2022\u2022\u00a0 GOT A TIP?

The USS Nimitz carrier group was jam-packed with high-tech sensor systems, but over a period of two weeks those sensors were repeatedly stymied by the appearance and disappearance of unidentified objects in the vicinity of the fleet. CDR David Fravor, the highly esteemed leader of the Navy's best aviators, the Strike Fighter Squadron 41 (also known as the \"Black Aces\u201d), was directed to pursue one of the mystery objects. Fravor's encounter with a craft now known as the TIC TAC UFO, might be the most important UAP incident of all time - even though the case was not formally investigated until six years later. When details about the encounter were first exposed to the public in 2017, Fravor's life changed forever.  What was learned during the subsequent investigation, and why is Fravor considered by many to be the most credible UFO witness ever? Years before Fravor's story was reported by the New York Times, the veteran aviator shared the details with Jeremy and George. In this episode, WEAPONIZED revisits the TIC TAC UFO case - and the aviator whose close encounter launched a global demand for further disclosures.  GOT A TIP?

This launches Dave into interrogation mode to find out everything about the timeline: did they talk at all when they met at the ACM, was there any overlap at all, when she broke up with her ex, when she started talking to and dating Zach, if the necklace she is wearing is the same one Zach gave his ex, why she hid it from Dave and the world, whether or not her and Zach tip waitresses, if she has heard his unreleased music and album, and much more. We are also joined by her lawyer O\u2019Malley (who is there to provide evidence and back up Bri in this court case) and THREE very special guests that we never thought would make it on the pod.  After an extensive interrogation we get into headlines where Alix Earle is (maybe?) cheating on Braxton Berrios with a 17 year old, Georgia Hassarati & Harry Jowsey\u2019s beef, Travis Kelce trying to give his number to Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s estranged wife speaking out, Livvy Dunne and Julia Ernst getting in hot water for photoshopping pictures, if Brittany Mahomse accidentally exposed herself being in an open relationship, Harry Styles still having and Olivia Wilde tattoo, and the very tragic passing of Angus Cloud.  We wrap up with BFFs corner where Dave has announced the One Bite Pizza Fest which will be the greatest gathering of pizzerias in one place ever (tickets at https://onebitepizzafest.com) and we figure out if Bri really thinks that Dave and the BFFs have her back when all is said and done.

I love rap because not every collab needs to \u201cmake sense\u201d on first glance. As long as the artists in question are on the same page artistically, know their strengths, and are willing to take risks and compromise when needed, the results can be great. This is precisely what we get with today\u2019s guests, Uncommon Nasa and Guilty Simpson, on their latest collaborative album, Escalation. As highly respected veterans in their respective hometown hubs of hip-hop, they possess a strong connection as it relates to their perspectives on the craft, and how they approach making music. In today\u2019s episode, this dynamic duo talks about key lessons they learnt from their careers (involving legendary artists like Dilla, Sean Price, and the original Def Jux crew), their artistic development, the Detroit hip-hop sound really, and the creation of their latest musically exhilarating collaborative album, Escalation.  Current era of rap vs. pre-internet era of rap (3:32). Mainstream hip-hop scene (22:11). Key lessons Nasa learnt from his early days working on Def Jux projects (30:55).

But I promise you, today\u2019s guests truly embody these terms to the fullest degree. maassai and JWords, otherwise known as H31R, are a duo hailing from Brooklyn who sport an ingenious sound that blends electronics and drum n bass elements with hip-hop, supplied by producer JWords. These sounds are paired with confident, heady, and effortlessly fly rhymes from the MC of the group, maassai. Great in their own right as solo artists, together they are an entirely different beast.

So I\u2019m kind of annoying when it comes to certain things with music. Albums where the last verse isn\u2019t from the main artist? It just doesn\u2019t feel right. Remixes? I\u2019m oddly wed to the original. And finally, producer albums with a bunch of different rappers on it are another type of record, where I don't usually gravitate towards. I\u2019m just such a concept and theme guy I guess. But I am a fair man... Today\u2019s guest on the show, New York-based producer Blockhead, recently dropped an album that was so good it overcame my annoying biases with The Aux, released on Backwoodz Studioz. I caught up with the very talented and very funny and personable producer to understand how he\u2019s approached collaboration with some of the genre\u2019s finest lyricists in Aesop Rock and billy woods, discuss his perspectives on the current production landscape, and the makings of his terrific new album.

To me, one of the things that impresses me the most about music is its ability to make me care about life experiences, perspectives, and topics that I either don\u2019t know anything about, or have no relation to my current day-to-day life. Today\u2019s guest, rapper-producer Pink Navel from Massachusetts, is a prime example of being so good at what they do, that they make me care about something I normally could care less about. This thing in question being video games, because on Pink Navel\u2019s latest album fully produced by Kenny Segal, How to Capture Playful, the whimsical passion, lyrical and musical brilliance all combine to create one of the strongest albums of 2023 with video games as its core foundational subject. In this episode, Pink Navel dives into their expressive style of rap, Ruby Yacht, and the makings of their terrific brand-new album.

It makes people feel more comfortable around you, and gravitate towards you because there is a certain solidness or realness about you that people can latch on to. This is a concept that 100% applies to music, and in particular rap, which is a type of music that is heavily based on the listener caring about the artist\u2019s personality and character - not just their technical skill. Although it certainly is nice when both the skill and the authenticity are present, which is precisely the case with Portland rapper, Milc. Milc is one of the most talented and genuinely funny rappers out right now, who is making an increasingly large mark on the game. His recent run is punctuated by a string of collaborative records with talented producers, such as Televangel and goldenbeets. Milc joins the show today to talk about how he injects his personality into his music, his key influences, and the makings of his two most recent records from 2023, Horseradish and The Fish That Saved Portland. The backstory behind is simple, but dope rap name (4:13). Portland hip-hop scene (5:38). Injecting personality in Milc\u2019s music (10:28). Sean Price, and other key influences for Milc (17:35).

Cool-Aid. This was a record that did so much good to my spirit, helping me get through some really tough times this year. Therefore, I\u2019m sure you can imagine how honoured I feel to welcome Pink Siifu to the show to not only dive into the creation of this masterpiece, but also discuss what he\u2019s learnt from legendary musicians, his chameleon-like versatility as an artist, and how he approaches collaboration.

As a 28 year-old hip-hop head, I\u2019d like to say that I\u2019m still somewhat young. So given this youth of mine, I haven\u2019t been able to witness many of the greatest movements or waves in hip-hop history firsthand. I wasn\u2019t even alive when Wu first jumped onto the scene. I could barely form sentences when Company Flow\u2019s debut album dropped But that thankfully has not been the case with what Backwoodz Studioz, and in particular what today\u2019s guests in billy woods and E L U C I D, have blessed listeners with so far in their careers. For over a decade now, I\u2019ve been able to follow these two refine their craft and expand on their brand of phenomenally rich, creative, and thoughtful hip-hop music that scratches all of the itches I have in music. All of which is funneled into this style of rap that makes the term \u201cone-of-a-kind\u201d, feel somehow too generic of a descriptor for what these two really do. I\u2019m pleased to have Armand Hammer on the show to discuss what makes their creative connection so special, the makings of one of the best albums I\u2019ve ever heard (no hyperbole) in We Buy Diabetic Test Strips, and much, much more!

The ability to have tough conversations about complex topics is an art. It requires not only a great deal of nuanced knowledge on a topic to speak thoughtfully on it, but it also requires a great deal of self-awareness and empathy. On The Golem of Brooklyn OST, Defcee successfully has one of these tough conversations with the community of white Jewish people he is a part of. He uses Adam Mansbach\u2019s new novel as inspiration to depict thoughtful, and funny stories related to Jewish ideals and folklore in a contemporary context. Furthermore, Defcee levies criticisms that he has for his people, delivered from a place of love and understanding. This concept is bolstered by the mystical, tone-setting instrumentals from the one and only Messiah Musik, who joins me alongside Defcee to dig deep into the makings of one of the best albums of the year, bar none. Vast differences in how The Golem of Brooklyn was created vs. Trapdoor (3:48). Main themes of Adam Mansbach\u2019s novel, and what inspired the soundtrack\u2019s creation (8:18).\u00a0 Adam Mansbach\u2019s involvement in the creative process of the soundtrack (15:55). How the concept shaped Messiah\u2019s approach to the soundtrack\u2019s sound (18:13). The important conversation Defcee wanted to have with the Jewish community on The Golem of Brooklyn (22:50). The timing of sharing these perspectives related to Judaism and whiteness, given the context of the heightened attention on anti-Semitism in the current socio-political climate (30:46). What Defcee and Messiah took away from The Golem creative process, as it relates to their experience as white Jewish people (39:19). How much of The Golem of Brooklyn was based on the content of the book vs. personal experience (44:22). Favourite songs (45:53).

This edition of the Conversation Pieces series is the most ambitious and personal thing I've ever done. It almost felt a bit too close to home to put out publicly, but honestly... creating this was truly a prime example of that 'writing = therapy' trope.  Leather Blvd. is an album that soundtracked the happiest time of my entire life. This record was chock-full of musical brilliance. But more importantly, Leather Blvd was so impactful to me, due to its raw expression of romance. Through the lens of a recent event in my personal life, I explore the bountiful emotional richness of this album, and how music is so intrinsically intertwined with real emotions, memories, and experiences that we have.

In this episode, Richmond-born Frank, otherwise known as rapper-producer Fly Anakin joins the show.

On rare occasion, we get two artists that come together at a moment where their skillsets and mindsets align in sublime harmony. That is what I see with Fatboi Sharif and steel tipped dove\u2019s latest album released on Backwoodz Studioz, titled Decay. Sharif\u2019s been progressively growing as a vocalist and lyricist\u2026 who\u2019s unique gifts mesh perfectly with the vast, atmospheric, and cutting-edge brand of experimentation found in steel tipped dove\u2019s production. Decay is a soundtrack for the times. Not necessarily the times that are upon us at this very moment, but what may soon be our reality in just a few decades from now. Decay is a psychedelic masterpiece - a result of two creative minds joining forces at the exact right time in their careers. Sharif and Dove are here today to breakdown how this excellent new album was created, in the latest installment of the 'Album Alchemy' series. The sonic landscape of Decay (4:03).

If you weren\u2019t already aware, hip-hop is in a great place. One of the biggest reasons why I feel this way is because the genre has become like a Republican\u2019s nightmare\u2026 it\u2019s borderless. It has become second nature for a rap album to feature countless different influences, incorporating multiple subsets of music within the hip-hop realm, and outside it as well. Richmond, Virginia-based McKinley Dixon is an artist who folks throughout the years would attempt to classify, as the \"conscious rapper\", and then after the \"jazz rapper\". But with artists like McKlinley Dixon, and his new album Beloved Paradise Jazz?!, whether the music is technically jazz rap, pop rap, big band rap is irrelevant. The mixture of these varying styles of music is so seamless, which makes the end-product defy previous formulas and classifications that your mind may want to tack on to it. McKinley simply makes good music, following his ambitious artistic vision wherever it takes him. So I am honoured to welcome McKinley Dixon to the show to speak about how he creates such rich eclectic music, his take on music\u2019s ability to inspire change in the world, and the making of his fantastic new album, Beloved! Paradise! Jazz!? McKinley\u2019s passion for making holistic, narrative-driven albums (4:27). McKinley\u2019s musical background and love for jazz (9:04). The role music can play in inspiring change (14:16). The musical vision for Beloved! Paradise! Jazz!? (22:38). The concise nature of Beloved! Paradise! Jazz!? (25:21).

In the case of the album Incorruptible Saints, we don\u2019t have to choose. The emotional impact is supplied in equal parts through rhyme, and instrumental. Honest introspection in the lyrics come from Nebraska rapper Sleep Sinatra, which were placed atop gorgeous, warm, abstract soundscapes created by Portland producer Televangel. Televangel is formerly known as Young God, and previously served as one half of the critically acclaimed production duo, Blue Sky Black Death. Televangel\u2019s creative musical brushstrokes did wonders to bring out Sleep Sinatra\u2019s thoughtful perspectives and vulnerability.

Styles of music such as jazz, R&B, soul, and funk, have all been inseparable elements in the fabric of hip-hop production since its inception. One particular form of music that has not played nearly as much of a significant role though, is rock music. That brings us to the subject of today's episode, Ritual, an album by Topeka Kansas rapper Stik Figa, and producer The Expert based in Dublin, Ireland,\u00a0who\u2019s production features a healthy dose of psychedelic rock samples that are executed brilliantly. The Expert puts those sounds into a blender with traditional golden-age and jazz sounds that rap purists will surely appreciate. The sound, however, is not all that makes Ritual notable since it is a project that may have ended up being the last album hip-hop veteran Stik Figa would ever create. To learn more about Ritual, Stik Figa and The Expert join the show to dive deep into how this album was made, as the next instalment of the Album Alchemy series.

No disco, acompanhamos a jornada de K Dot, um jovem cujas a\u00e7\u00f5es foram influenciadas pelo caos de Compton e resultaram em Kendrick Lamar, um homem que encontrou reden\u00e7\u00e3o por meio da m\u00fasica e que vive pelos princ\u00edpios do amor, da fam\u00edlia e Deus. J\u00e1 em \u201cTo Pimp a Butterfly\u201d (2015), vemos a sequ\u00eancia dessa hist\u00f3ria. Agora, Kendrick \u00e9 um \u00edcone global, transportado para um mundo desconhecido de fama, riqueza, influ\u00eancia e tenta\u00e7\u00e3o. O rapper estrutura o trabalho em torno de uma narrativa de transforma\u00e7\u00e3o, de lagarta \u00e0 borboleta, de prostituta a cafet\u00e3o, abordando no meio desse caminho debates sobre racismo, viol\u00eancia policial e desigualdade racial no sistema de justi\u00e7a dos Estados Unidos.

Sempre adepta a um repert\u00f3rio m\u00faltiplo e diverso, Catto se debru\u00e7ou sobre a obra de Gal para um espet\u00e1culo e disso nasceu o disco \u201cBelezas S\u00e3o Coisas Acesas Por Dentro\u201d (2023). Em tempos de homenagens ca\u00e7a-n\u00edquel, a artista ga\u00facha se sentiu reticente em como abordar essas can\u00e7\u00f5es, mas escolheu a \u00fanica via poss\u00edvel, isto \u00e9, aquela ainda n\u00e3o trilhada. De produ\u00e7\u00e3o calcada no rock, a cantora n\u00e3o obedece ditames e faz com essas can\u00e7\u00f5es aquilo que Gal tamb\u00e9m fazia: as desconstr\u00f3i e as reconstr\u00f3i de acordo com o que for melhor, de acordo com que o hoje pede.

He\u2019s got experience in both the investment and streaming sides of the industry and so we talk about two things that are distantly, yet directly, connected: the recently mooted\u00a0artist-centric payment systems that divide up money to artists from streaming platforms in new ways \u2013\u00a0and the service that Duetti provides, giving artists another route to the money that their songs will make.  Lior talks about who would benefit the most if an artist-centric system was widely rolled out \u2013\u00a0and whether it would please artist who have been calling for a fairer remuneration model. He also talks about Duetti\u2019s work, who they target, and how artists may use services like this to unlock value from songs alongside streaming income.

We seem to be shifting into an era where a new and widespread use of music is emerging \u2013 where music is a component of a wider experience: for instance in the background of short/long videos, live streams of gaming, or as part of users building interactive experiences - almost \u201cmusic as Lego\u201d. We chat to Paul about the future of music usage and whether the current system of licensing is up to the task of recovering the correct money for music creators. Creators of online content\u00a0are eager to use recognisable hit songs in what they make. And Paul Samson has an interesting perspective on these creators needs \u2013 whether they are zillion-streaming superstars like MrBeast, or more modestly-successful creators. So we ask him about what they actually want from music, and also how they view music in terms of its use and its value, when they are perhaps only using it as a component of something bigger that they\u2019re piecing together. Plus we ask Paul about generative AI music \u2013 and whether this could take a slice out of his business model.

But vinyl records are an old technology - so how might a modern record be made? Sven Deutschmann is Managing Director of Sonopress, a company that makes vinyl records and other physical media. He showed Music Ally\u2019s Editor Joe Sparrow a new type of disc and\u00a0spoke about a new process of making records that uses the same plastic used in plastic water bottles, and that uses significantly less energy \u2013 and creates less waste. It's called EcoRecord and is made by injection moulding, not pressing, and is produced using polyethylene terephthalate (PET) as its base material rather than polyvinyl chloride (PVC). They can also be produced using 100% recycled PET.\u00a0 Creating the discs requires neither natural gas nor steam, and Sonopress says its test operation saw energy savings of up to 85% compared to the traditional process. The product is being launched in collaboration with Warner Music.

Eliane Ellbogen is an intellectual property lawyer at Fasken law firm in Montreal, and has spoken at a number of conferences about the legal implications that accompany AI Music. She joined Music Ally's Editor Joe Sparrow, who lobbed some (depending on your point of view) tricky and/or stupid legal questions at Eliane \u2013 who answered them with patience and clarity. For instance: can an AI author music? Can humans claim ownership of AI-generated music? What happens if an AI-created piece of music sounds very similar to your own human music? What laws might be used to regulate it all? Eliane gamely got to grips with them all.

Editor Joe Sparrow welcomes them back to the podcast to update us on the state of streaming fraud \u2013 and they have some truly shocking statistics to share. They chat to Joe about the recent changes in streaming fraud, what percentage of all streaming is actually fraudulent, how many billions of dollars will be siphoned out via fraud this year, and reveal a remarkable statistic: that 40%-60% of all streams from songs distributed\u00a0 via many well-known distributors are fraudulent.\u00a0 (It\u2019s worth noting we spoke before some DSPs announced changes to their payment thresholds, which will require songs to get a certain number of streams before payout.)

They chat to Music Ally\u2019s Editor Joe Sparrow about why they think producers, artists and writers will want to use AI to transform their own voice to sound like one of their featured artists. One of the difficulties that songwriters and songwriting producers face is using their own voice to sing lyrics on a track that is designed for someone else: perhaps their own voice is not very good, or perhaps it\u2019s too hard to picture another artist performing the demo. This was a problem that Dan Stein, as DJ Fresh, faced \u2013 and he and his founders are addressing this issue with the help of AI. Voice Swap allows people to sing something into their platform, and the resulting output will sound like one of the singers whose voices the AI has been trained on. Dan and Declan talk about their technology, and who will be interested in using it, and they also dig into some of the more complex concepts: like whether particular AI voices might become ubiquitous across pop music, and whether this will diminish or boost human creativity.

But it\u2019s not as simple as \u201amusic against AI\u2019 \u2013 there are new concepts that are being discussed around who gets to choose how music is used and by whom.\u00a0 \u2771 AI is not just about pushing a button \u2013\u00a0AI music is seen by some as profoundly uncreative: you hit a button and a song comes out - and it\u2019s probably not very good. But that\u2019s not actually the direction of travel: the latest wave of musical AIs are about prompting platforms into creating good snippets of music then human musicians using their creativity to turn them into better work.\u00a0 \u201cJohnny Cash\u201d sings Barbie Girl \u2013 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAFdzBTe2lg Tach Teaches \u2013 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REqIJJLJbsc Cathy Dennis\u2019 \u201cToxic\u201d demo \u2013\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7dk9DXFrwk Skipping robots \u2013 https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/462433-most-skips-by-a-robot-in-one-minute ------ \ud83d\udc49 FREE Amazon Music for Artists courses & certification:\u00a0\u2060https://learn.musically.com/courses/amazon-music-for-artists/\u2060 \ud83d\udc4b\u00a0\u2060The Knowledge\u2060, Music Ally\u2019s free weekly newsletter:\u00a0\u2060musically.lnk.to/knowledgepo\u2060 \ud83c\udf89 You may be eligible for a FREE Music Ally subscription, worth \u00a3399/year, via our\u00a0\u2060corporate and sponsored subscriptions\u2060.

He believes for instance, that mass adoption of generative music as a creative tool will be through video content creators \u2013 who may be keen to \"co-create\" music for their videos with an AI trained on their favourite artist \u2013 and he talks about how the integration of AI music into streaming platfroms could change how much money is paid out to human creators.

TikTok has captured the attention of people in every area of the music industry, who now look to the short-video app for A&R, marketing, music discovery, audience-building and fan-nurturing. Darina Connolly, Head of Artist & Label Partnerships, talks about TikTok\u2019s direction and strategy, and she\u2019s joined by Label Partnerships Manager Lisa Skeppner, who is one of the go-to TikTok people when it comes to classical music. Music Ally's Editor Joe Sparrow asks them what it is about classical music that holds users\u2019 attentions \u2013 is it the song, the performance, the context of the song\u2019s use, or the artists themselves? And what can non-classical artists learn for how they use TikTok?  We talk to Darina and Lisa about how classical music has connected on TikTok, and the impact on classical artists \u2013\u00a0and also they talk more widely about what it means for users to be discovering new \u201cold\" music this way \u2013 and what the longer-term impacts of that are beyond short-term spikes in attention around novel genres.

Stuart explains why this simple-sounding question is actually quite complex and how it could raise a number of fundamental legal issues around payments to artists and rightsholders. Streaming platforms have always provided radio-like experiences: whether something simple like \"lean back\" listening \u2013 where you hit play and the platform chooses what music you hear \u2013 or more overt concepts like Spotify's new AI DJ, creating what is\u00a0a recognisable personalised radio-like experience. So at what point should streaming music be classed as \"radio\"? Moreover, streaming services want to compete with regular radio, to attract its listeners and advertisers. What does it mean, then, if streaming and radio's boundaries are blurring? Editor Joe Sparrow puts these questions, and more, to Stuart.  ------ \ud83d\udc4b\u00a0The Knowledge, Music Ally\u2019s free weekly newsletter:\u00a0musically.lnk.to/knowledgepo \ud83c\udf89 You may be eligible for a FREE Music Ally subscription, worth \u00a3399/year, via our\u00a0corporate and sponsored subscriptions.
