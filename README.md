## Project Management

### 📋 Jira

Jira is a tool used for the organization and tracking of our project. With functions such as task management, error tracking and reporting of project processes, it allows team work to be carried out in a more organized and efficient manner. Through Jira, we ensure that all team members have constant up-to-date information about their tasks, processes and the overall progress of the project.

### 🔁 Agile Method

Agile is a flexible and iterative approach that we adopt during the development process of our project. This approach ensures that our project progresses quickly and effectively, while at the same time adapting quickly to changing requirements. Within the Agile methodology, we work in sprints of 1 or 2 weeks. Each sprint is defined by specific goals and tasks, and during this process, team members focus on the set goals. At the end of the sprints, the work performed is reviewed and plans are made for the next sprint. This process ensures that our project is constantly evolving and that effective communication and collaboration between team members is maintained.
